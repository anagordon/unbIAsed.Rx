Regardless of the treatment arm a subject is in, the study drug was up-titrated to the highest tolerated dose level during the scheduled study visits. The different strengths of the two study drugs were not identical in appearance so the possible dose modification(s) during the treatment period could not be performed in a blinded manner. Subjects started on valsartan 80 mg BID or sacubitril/valsartan 100 mg BID dose and there was only one scheduled up-titration visit after the randomization. Exception for this were the subjects that were on valsartan 160 mg BID dose during the run-in phase. These subjects were randomized directly to valsartan 160 mg BID or sacubitril/valsartan 100 mg BID. Subjects that were randomized to valsartan arm had similar visit after which they continued on the same dose. For subjects that were randomized from valsartan 160 mg BID to sacubitril/valsartan 100 mg BID the dose was up-titrated to 200 mg BID if clinically possible.\n\nThe total duration for each patient was planned to be about 14 weeks but could be longer if required for scheduling purposes .
