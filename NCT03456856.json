Changes in HR from baseline will be correlated with the changes from baseline in activity level of the subjects, as measured by both a standard 6-minute walk distance and an accelerometer device.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that ivabradine effectively reduces HR between baseline and day 57 in African-American/Black subjects. Because mean reductions of approximately 5 beat per minute (bpm) have been observed in the overall placebo-treated subjects in the SHIFT study as well as in the placebo-treated subjects of the subgroup analysis of non-African-American/Black subjects enrolled in the SHIFT study, we will test whether the mean reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm, and estimate the degree to which the mean reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure (HF)"], "keywords": ["Cardiac", "Congestive", "Decompensation", "Heart Failure", "Left-Sided", "Myocardial", "Corlanor", "Ivabradine", "African American", "Black", "Michigan"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 30, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Ivabradine", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The starting dose of ivabradine was 5 mg twice daily (BID), although investigators had the discretion to start participants at 2.5 mg BID if participant had a history of conduction defects, or bradycardia that could lead to hemodynamic compromise.
