Azilsartan medoxomil is being tested to treat Chinese people who have essential hypertension. This study will look at change in blood pressure after 8 weeks of treatment in people who take azilsartan medoxomil compared to people who take valsartan.\n\nThe study enrolled 612 patients. Prior to the start of study treatment, participants who have not received antihypertensive treatment within 28 days participated in a 2-week -run in period. Upon completion of the run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):\n\n* azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg\n* azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg\n* Valsartan 160 mg\n\nAll participants were asked to take study medication at the same time each day throughout the study.\n\nThis multi-centre trial was conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 14 weeks.
