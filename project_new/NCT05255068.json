The OPTIMAL is designed to teach staff to effectively engage residents in eating using individualized, person-centered behavioral strategies.", "detailedDescription": "This study developed and refined OPTIMAL, and evaluated its feasibility, fidelity, and usefulness. We used mixed methods (i.e., focus groups, a pilot single-group repeated measures) to refine and test OPTIMAL. We collected repeated measures at 3 time points: baseline (T1), immediately post intervention (6 weeks post baseline, T2), and 6-week post intervention (12 weeks post baseline, T3). At each time point, we assessed quality of staff engagement and resident outcomes including eating performance and BMI through collection and coding of videotaped observations of dyadic mealtime interaction (videos; Aim 2\\&3) over 6 meals in 2 consecutive days (2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, 2 dinners) for each staff-resident dyad. We used Cue Utilization and Engagement in Dementia (CUED) mealtime video coding scheme, an innovative, feasible, and reliable tool that our team has developed and validated, and assessed resident mealtime challenging behaviors including resistive behaviors and functional impairments and intake success rate using videos collected in this study.11, 25\n\nThe specific aims are:\n\n1. Develop, evaluate, and refine OPTIMAL intervention protocol and training materials. We will integrate evidence from literature and our prior work to develop the intervention protocol and training materials, addressing resident mealtime difficulties, targeted PCMC strategies, and establishment of individualized PCMC plans. We will conduct separate focus group interviews of staff and family participants on the acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention protocol and training materials before pilot testing. Data obtained will be used to refine the intervention protocol and training materials before pilot testing.\n2. Determine feasibility, fidelity, and usefulness of OPTIMAL. Feasibility on participant identification, recruitment, consent, and retention will be evaluated descriptively. Fidelity will be assessed on a) delivery of treatment (staff attendance to training sessions), b) receipt of treatment (staff knowledge and self-efficacy pre- \\& post-training), and c) enactment of treatment skills (staff PCMC\\&TCMC behaviors, quality of staff engagement). We will conduct focus group interviews of staff to assess the usefulness of OPTIMAL after T3.\n3. Describe resident outcomes (Exploratory). We will measure and describe resident mealtime difficulties, eating performance, intake success rate, body weight, and body mass index using descriptive statistics over time for two treatment groups. Data obtained will inform estimates of effect sizes for a future larger-scale trial."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias"], "keywords": ["Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias", "Mealtime", "Eating", "Behavioral Symptoms", "Food Intake", "Function", "Nutrition", "Nursing Homes"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE", "maskingDescription": "Because this study is a single-group design, all participants were recruited from the nursing home site that was assigned as the intervention group. no one is blinded to the intervention assignment, but all participants and outcome assessors were blinded for the research questions/aims."}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 111, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Staff", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Start participants who enrolled in the study, received the OPTIMAL intervention, and were observed during data collection.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: OPTIMAL"]}, {"label": "Resident", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Resident participants who were cared in the study site, and received care from the staff participants before and after the OPTIMAL intervention was delivered to staff.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: OPTIMAL"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "OPTIMAL", "description": "A person-centered mealtime care intervention", "armGroupLabels": ["Resident", "Staff"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Staff Participants Who Viewed the Intervention as Appropriate and Acceptable for Mealtime Care Practice", "description": "All staff participants were interviewed on whether the intervention protocol and training materials were acceptable and appropriate for nursing home mealtime care practice before pilot testing.", "timeFrame": "After recruitment of staff participants and before T1 (baseline)"}, {"measure": "Number of Staff and Resident Participants Recruited and Retained for the Study", "description": "The number of staff and resident participants that were recruited at baseline and retained over the study period were collected to indicate the feasibility of the study on participant recruitment, consent and retention.", "timeFrame": "From recruitment/consent throughout the study completion, up to 12-weeks post baseline"}, {"measure": "The Number of Staff Participants Who Attended All Training Sessions", "description": "A checklist was used to track the number of staff participants who attended all the group and/or individual training sessions that were provided in the study.", "timeFrame": "During each OPTIMAL training session (within 2 weeks post baseline)"}, {"measure": "Staff Person-centered Care Knowledge and Self-efficacy", "description": "Training receipt, indicated by a total score of \u2265 75% on the staff PCMC-related knowledge \\& self-efficacy test post-training with or without booster sessions.
