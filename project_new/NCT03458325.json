To evaluate differences in healthcare resource utilization and direct medical costs for patients treated with the Furoscix Infusor outside the hospital versus patients receiving intravenous furosemide for \u2264 72 hours in the hospital setting for 30 days post-discharge from the emergency department.\n2. To evaluate the safety of Furoscix administered outside the hospital.\n3. To evaluate and describe quality of life and patient satisfaction for patients who receive the Furoscix Infusor outside the hospital setting.", "detailedDescription": "This adaptive clinical trial will include a prospective treatment arm (i.e., Furoscix administered via the Furoscix Infusor) administered outside the hospital that will be compared to a propensity-matched historical control arm of patients admitted to the hospital for \u2264 72 hours (i.e., Treatment As Usual (TAU)) that will be derived from administrative claims data. Eligible patients for the Furoscix arm will be patients with HF and fluid overload who initially present to the emergency department (ED) and who are expected to require parenteral diuresis.\n\nIf it is determined by the investigator that the patient requires parenteral diuresis or continued diuresis outside of the ED care setting and meets all study eligibility criteria, he/she may be consented and enrolled into the study.\n\nThe treatment comprises a preprogrammed bi-phasic 5-hour drug administration. Subjects will be instructed on the use of the Furoscix Infusor by the investigator and/or study staff in accordance with the instructions for use. The initial dose of the study product may be administered in the ED or at home. Additional doses will be provided to the subject for self-administration or administration by a caregiver in the home setting as directed by the investigator or study staff. The total duration in days and total number of doses of the initial therapy will be determined by the investigator based on an estimated volume of diuresis desired to transition patient back to their oral diuretic maintenance therapy. Subjects will receive scheduled at-home telephone calls from a HF nurse on Days 1 and 7 and one call between Days 14-21. Planned in-clinic visits will be conducted between Day 2-4 and then Day 30. Unscheduled at-home telephone calls by a HF nurse and unscheduled in-clinic visits may be performed if felt clinically indicated by the study team or the clinical provider.\n\nThe study period will be up to 30 days after enrollment.
