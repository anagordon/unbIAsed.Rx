We are testing a new way to help patients share their preferences for talking about end-of-life care with their clinicians and families. To do this we created a simple, short feedback form. The form is designed to help clinicians understand what patients would like to talk about. The goal of this research study is to show that using a feedback form is possible and can be helpful for patients and their families.", "detailedDescription": "Four decades of research on end-of-life care indicate that people who are dying often spend their final days with a significant burden of pain and other symptoms and receive care they would not choose. Patient-clinician communication about end-of-life care is an important focus for improving care for three reasons: 1) when it occurs, it is associated with improved quality of life, reduced anxiety, and fewer intensive life-sustaining therapies at the end of life; 2) physicians frequently do not have discussions about end-of-life care with their patients even though most patients desire these discussions; and 3) our preliminary studies suggest that a simple intervention based on each patient's informational needs and preferences can increase the occurrence and quality of patient-clinician communication about end-of-life care. By tailoring patient-clinician discussions to the individual patient, patients will be able to make care decisions that are best for them and clinicians will be able to provide patients with the care patients' desire.\n\nOur long-term goal is to ensure that patients receive the end-of-life care they desire through improved patient-clinician communication. If effective, this health-system intervention will improve: 1) the occurrence and quality of patient-centered communication about end-of-life care for patients with chronic life-limiting illness and their families; 2) the agreement between patients' wishes for care and care received; and 3) the burden of symptoms of anxiety and depression experienced by patients and families.\n\nWe propose a randomized trial of a feedback form, called a \"Jumpstart\" form, provided to patients, family members and clinicians, specifying the individual patient's communication needs and preferences concerning end-of- life care. The trial will be tested with clinicians (n=120) who provide primary or specialty care to eligible patients at clinics of two large healthcare systems. Eligible patients (up to 6 per clinician, goal n=500) will include those with chronic, life-limiting illness. Family members of patients and interdisciplinary team members of primary clinicians may participate. Primary clinicians will be randomized to the intervention or usual care. The intervention's effectiveness will be compared with usual care using validated self-report questionnaires that will be collected longitudinally (baseline/enrollment, within 2 weeks of the target visit, 3 months, 6 months) from patients and families. Analyses include statistical approaches that take into account that there will be more than one patient for each physician and that data are collected at multiple time points.\n\nOutcomes of this study include patient assessments of: 1) frequency and quality of patient/clinician communication; 2) agreement between care patients desire and care patients receive; and 3) symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nWe will also use qualitative data to accomplish the following goals: 1) to explore subjects' experiences with the study's activities; 2) to understand barriers to participation; and 3) to explore patient and family experiences with the intervention. To obtain these goals, we will contact a total of 30-40 participants, selected from all subject groups, to participate in one-on-one semi-structured interviews during which they will be asked to share their experiences as a study participant and their perspectives on study activities."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Critical Illness", "Chronic Disease", "Terminal Care", "Palliative Care", "Communication", "Advance Care Planning", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Lung Neoplasms", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Heart Failure", "End Stage Liver Disease", "Kidney Failure, Chronic"], "keywords": ["Palliative Care", "End-of-Life Issues", "Patient/Clinician Communication", "Patient/Family Communication", "Concordance", "Treatment Preferences", "Anxiety", "Depressive Symptoms", "Talking with Your Doctor", "Coping with Serious Illness", "Outpatient Collaboration"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 817, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Feedback Group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects will complete surveys and assessments and will be given the Communication Feedback Form for Patients with Serious Illness to use prior to and during a target outpatient visit.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Communication Feedback Form for Patients with Serious Illness"]}, {"label": "Comparison/Usual Care Group", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Subjects will only complete surveys and assessments."}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Communication Feedback Form for Patients with Serious Illness", "description": "The intervention, based on self-efficacy theory, identifies patients' preferences for communication about end-of-life care (EOLC) and barriers and facilitators to this communication, and collates these data into a feedback form.
