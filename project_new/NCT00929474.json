Additionally in CRT patients it has been demonstrated that optimizing paced/sensed atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (V-V) timings leads to immediate hemodynamic benefits and further improves cardiac function. Recent studies have shown that optimal paced/sensed AV and V-V delays change over time, which raises the question of how often optimization should be repeated. Thus, frequent re-optimization of these delays might be beneficial for maintaining significant improvement of cardiac function. However, it remains to be evaluated whether timing optimization may be beneficial on patients who have received CRT for a number of years and are now having the CRT device replaced.", "detailedDescription": "* This is a prospective, randomized, and multicenter study\n* Patients who have received a replacement St. Jude Medical(SJM) CRT device, either CRT-P or CRT-D, within the last two weeks post CRT replacement will be considered for enrollment in the study.\n* Baseline measurements will be performed at the time of enrollment.\n* Patients are followed up to 12 months post CRT replacement with data collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post CRT replacement.\n* Patients will be randomized at enrollment to either Group 1 (use of SJM algorithm to optimize programming) or Group 2 (\"Control\")."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 17, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "QuickOpt", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Device: QuickOpt - SJM CRT (Group 1)"]}, {"label": "Control", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Device: Control - SJM CRT (Group 2)"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "QuickOpt - SJM CRT (Group 1)", "description": "The patient's device is programmed to sequential Bi-V pacing mode with paced/sensed AV and V-V delays optimized using QuickOpt.
