Infants with the syndrome generally undergo a staged surgical approach in view of an ultimate Fontan procedure. Although long-term survival in patients with HLHS and related single ventricle physiology has improved markedly with advances in medical and surgical therapies, a growing number of infants will ultimately require heart transplantation for end-stage heart failure due to several potential disadvantages include a negative effect on right ventricular function, arrhythmia, additional volume load via regurgitation from the nonvalved shunt, and impaired growth of the pulmonary artery.\n\nRisk factors for poor outcome of heart transplantation with HLHS and single ventricle physiology are older age at transplantation and previous Fontan operation. New strategies are needed to improve the underlying transplant risks proper for the Fontan failure patients.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that heart-derived stem/progenitor cells can be used to improved cardiac function in patients with ischemic heart disease. In this trial, the investigators aimed to test the safety and feasibility of intracoronary injection of autologous cardiac progenitor cells in patients with HLHS and related single ventricle anomalies and that could improve ventricular function at 3 months' follow up.", "detailedDescription": "Autologous cardiac progenitor cells are isolated from patients' own cardiac tissues obtained during palliative shunt procedure.
