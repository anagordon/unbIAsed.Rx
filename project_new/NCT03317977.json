The study is a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design and will test RFC for use in real world, public healthcare settings.", "detailedDescription": "The study was conducted in the emergency department at Children's Hospital of Michigan; CHM). 170 adolescents with poorly controlled asthma and their primary caregivers will be enrolled. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, families were randomly assigned to six months of home-based family treatment consisting of either RFC or Michigan MATCH , a model program endorsed by the State of Michigan for treatment of poorly controlled asthma. Subsequently, all intervention content in both arms was delivered by telehealth. Treatment content of RFC consists of weekly sessions focusing on asthma education, asthma management skills, improving home-school community for asthma, access to care and case management. MATCH includes asthma education but is less intensive and does not focus on family management skills. Treatment was provided by community health workers (CHWs) employed by a community agency providing MATCH as their standard of care. Consent and data collection was completed at baseline with additional data collection visits at 6, 12 and 18 months after baseline. Data collection was completed by project research assistants and consists of questionnaires and interviews with the adolescent and parent to assess asthma management, asthma symptoms and hospital utilization. The data analyses were intent-to-treat, meaning that all randomized participants are included regardless of the intervention dose received. Trial data were analyzed using linear mixed effect models."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma in Children"], "keywords": ["Asthma management, adolescents"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 75, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Reach for Control", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Reach For Control is a multi-component, home-based family therapy that targets the multiple causes of poor adolescent asthma management across individual, family and community systems.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Reach for Control"]}, {"label": "Michigan MATCH", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Program endorsed by the State of Michigan for treatment of poorly controlled asthma.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: MATCH"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Reach for Control", "description": "In Phase 1 (weeks 1-4), the CHW conducts an initial intake and then completes a comprehensive functional analysis (FA) of behavior to determine the causes of poor asthma management for each youth regarding asthma management.
