This response is absent in adult asthmatics; however, there is data demonstrating that use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for short periods of time may decrease airway reactivity in adult asthmatics. This suggests that although deep inspirations may not result in decreased airway reactivity, sustained lung inflation may lead to changes in asthmatic airway smooth muscle structure that lead to a decrease in airway reactivity. The purpose of our study is to determine whether short and long term use of CPAP in children and adults leads to decreased airway reactivity. If airway reactivity is decreased with CPAP, this may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with asthma."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["asthma", "sleep apnea"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "BASIC_SCIENCE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 27, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "CPAP", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects will use CPAP of 8-12 during days 2 through 6 of the study.", "interventionNames": ["Device: CPAP-Continuous Positive Airway Pressure"]}, {"label": "SHAM", "type": "SHAM_COMPARATOR", "description": "Subjects will use sham CPAP of 0-2 during days 2 through 6 of the study.", "interventionNames": ["Device: SHAM"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "CPAP-Continuous Positive Airway Pressure", "description": "Cpap will be worn at night by subjects 6 to 7 days duration.", "armGroupLabels": ["CPAP"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "SHAM", "description": "SHAM will be worn at night by subjects 6 to 7 days duration.", "armGroupLabels": ["SHAM"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Provocative Concentration of Methacholine Causing a 20% Fall in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)", "description": "Methacholine is an inhaled medication used to assess asthma and reactive airways.
