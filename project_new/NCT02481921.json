Heart failure is a complex chronic illness where comprehensive patient-centered care is difficult and resource intensive. One potential solution is to use shared medical appointments (SMA), where a group of patients with the same disease process shared the same medical or clinic appointment. This can be provided by a multi-disciplinary team of providers with expertise in nutrition, nursing, behavior and medication management join to manage heart failure. The investigators will enroll patients from Providence, Cleveland and Phoenix VA Hospitals who were within 12 weeks of discharge from a heart failure hospitalization and/or an outpatient encounter (clinic, emergent or urgent care) that required IV diuretic therapy. Patients were randomized them to receive SMA intervention or usual care. Results from this project are expected to add an innovative intervention that could improve outcomes important for both the patient and the VA: health status, hospitalizations, and mortality.", "detailedDescription": "The primary goal of this research project is to improve the health status and outcomes for patients treated for heart failure (HF) via a group clinic or shared medical appointment approach where education to patients, disease monitoring and medication titration occurs. Studies have found patient self-care behaviors in HF (e.g. medication/dietary non-compliance) and health system factors (e.g. care discoordination, limited access, lack of education to patients and caregivers) played an important role in patient's health status and hospitalization risk to the extent that 50% of the readmissions were judged to be possibly/probably preventable. To address patient and system factors based on the Chronic Care Model, redesign of care delivery, via SMA's, can be a good solution to provide patient with peer support, self-management education while also performing disease monitoring and medication management in a group environment. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to enroll patients within 12 weeks of discharge from a heart failure hospitalization and/or an outpatient encounter (clinic, emergent or urgent care) that required IV diuretic therapy, and randomized them to receive either SMA intervention either weekly or bi-weekly for 4 total sessions versus usual care for HF. The investigators will determine, at 180 days from randomization, whether HF patients who participate in HF-SMA, as compared to patients who receive usual care:\n\n1. Experience better cardiac health status measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and overall health status measured by EQ5D;\n2. Have fewer hospitalization or death and\n3. Experience improvement in a) HF Self-Care behavior, or b) plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP levels.\n\nThe sites will be Providence VA, Cleveland VA and Phoenix VA hospitals to enroll a total of 250 patients. The study duration will be 180 days for all patients from the time of randomization. The investigators will use stratified randomization with the following variables: enrollment in other programs for HF Clinic, support group or education, \\<2 hospitalizations last 6 months, left ventricular ejection fraction \\<40% and study site. The team will consist of a nutritionist, social worker or health psychologist, a clinical pharmacist and/or nurse practitioner, without the presence of a physician (cardiologist will be available on call). The session will contain an assessment of patient needs, theme-based disease self-management education, patient-initiated disease management discussion, and break-out sessions of individualized medication case management."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["heart failure", "self-management", "group intervention"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Participants are assigned to either usual care group or the MEDIC-HF group in parallel for the duration of the study.", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 242, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "MEDIC-HF", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Group clinic or shared medical appointment of Education \\& Intervention in Heart Failure", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Group medical visits"]}, {"label": "Usual Care", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Usual care in heart failure"}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Group medical visits", "description": "Group clinics or shared medical appointments where a multidisciplinary team of providers with expertise in nutrition, nursing, behavior and/or medication management join to manage heart failure in addition to and in support of, the patient's regular individual clinic visits.", "armGroupLabels": ["MEDIC-HF"], "otherNames": ["SMA"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "EQ Visual Analog Scale (EQVAS)", "description": "A self-reported scale that reports how good or bad the respondent's health is TODAY, where higher scores mean a better health state.
