It was designed to evaluate the effect of ASV in hospitalized heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF) patients on a global rank endpoint of survival free from CV hospitalization and improvement in functional capacity measured by 6-minute walk distance. Analysis of the 126 subjects that were randomized showed a neutral result for the primary endpoint; however, in the pre-specified analysis of the primary endpoint by LVEF strata, there was a favorable statistically significant difference in the HFpEF subgroup (p=0.036).\n\nAlthough the CAT-HF study showed a positive signal in the HFpEF subgroup, these patients represented a small percentage of the randomized subjects in the study. The current study aims to show that by applying newer technologies to support adherence, as well as focusing on the lessons learned in CAT-HF to identify and recruit HFpEF patients, acceptable adherence to ASV therapy can be achieved in HFpEF patients."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure With Normal Ejection Fraction", "Sleep Apnea"], "keywords": ["adaptive servo-ventilation", "ASV", "HFpEF"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "Prospective, single-arm, un-blinded, multi-center", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 6, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "ASV Therapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "ASV Therapy", "interventionNames": ["Device: ASV Therapy"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "ASV Therapy", "description": "AirCurve 10 ASV device set up in AutoSet mode", "armGroupLabels": ["ASV Therapy"], "otherNames": ["AirCurve 10 ASV"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "ASV Adherence", "description": "Average hours used per day", "timeFrame": "3 months"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "KCCQ-12", "description": "Change in KCCQ-12 score.
