These include: a) identifying high risk individuals by using population derived imaging and blood biomarkers; and b) implementing novel exercise training and \"nutri-ceutical\" strategies in obese middle aged individuals with high amounts of visceral fat, an important risk factor in the development of heart failure and adverse cardiac remodeling.\n\nPrior work has demonstrated that: a) high levels of myocardial triglyceride content are associated with a smaller and less distensible left ventricle with reduced tissue relaxation rates compared to those with low levels and b) low fitness and high body mass index were the strongest predictors of elevated myocardial content. The consequences of excess visceral adiposity (intra- and retro-peritoneal adipose tissue) on cardiac remodeling suggest individuals with high visceral fat content and low fitness are at particularly high risk for heart failure.\n\nThe primary objective of this project is therefore to identify high risk, sedentary, middle aged obese individuals with high visceral fat levels, and initiate an exercise program in conjunction with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation designed to reduce visceral adiposity and regress myocardial triglyceride accumulation. Findings from this aim would have enormous public health significance and establish a novel, practical exercise training program and \"nutria-ceutical\" strategy to reverse obesity related cardiovascular remodeling.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nHigh aerobic exercise training in conjunction with daily omega-3 supplementation will reduce visceral myocardial triglyceride accumulation by reducing visceral adiposity. A reduction of myocardial fat will lead to improved LV structure and diastolic function by an approach that is not necessarily predicated on weight loss.\n\nSpecific Aim:\n\nTo test our hypothesis that reduction in myocardial triglyceride content will improve markers of diastolic function, we have designed a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. We will study four groups of previously sedentary obese middle aged subjects at high risk for development of HF for one year with the following interventions: A) sedentary controls taking placebo; B) sedentary subjects taking omega-3 fatty acids; C) subjects undergoing high intensity aerobic exercise training while on placebo and D) subjects undergoing high intensity aerobic exercise training while taking omega-3 fatty acids. Subjects will be categorized as high risk and enrolled on the basis of elevated serum biomarkers (cTnT) and high visceral fat content (\\>2.5 kg). We will perform comprehensive non-invasive assessments of cardiovascular structure and systolic/diastolic function before and after 1 year of an exercise intervention involving high intensity intervals and omega-3 administration. We anticipate the combination of high intensity aerobic exercise in conjunction with high dose omega-3 supplementation will reduce visceral adiposity, decrease myocardial triglyceride content and improve markers of diastolic and vascular function."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Obesity", "Heart Failure, Diastolic", "Metabolic Syndrome"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "FACTORIAL", "interventionModelDescription": "2x2 factorial design.
