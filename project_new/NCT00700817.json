The aim of this trial is to compare the effect on blood sugar control of liraglutide or sitagliptin, both in combination with metformin, in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone.\n\nThe trial has been extended by 52 weeks. The extension will consist of two 26-week periods:\n\n1. Week 27-52 after randomisation\n\n   - All subjects will continue receiving sitagliptin or liraglutide at unchanged dose and dosing regimen.\n2. Week 53-78 after randomisation\n\n   * Subjects receiving sitagliptin at the end of week 52 after randomisation will discontinue sitagliptin and will be randomised 1:1 to liraglutide 1.2 mg/day or liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Liraglutide will be initiated at a dose of 0.6 mg/day, and increased to 1.2 mg/day or 1.8 mg/day in weekly intervals.\n   * Subjects receiving liraglutide 1.2 mg/day or 1.8 mg/day at the end of week 52 after randomisation will continue the treatment at unchanged dose and dosing regimen.
