Individuals with CAE have brief staring spell seizures that occur suddenly, unpredictably, and frequently throughout the day. These seizures impair the children's ability to learn and play, and lead to higher injury rates.\n\nThere are many medications used to treat seizures, but only 3 generally are used as the first treatment for children with CAE: ethosuximide, lamotrigine, and valproic acid. The goal of this study is to determine which of these 3 medicines is the best first choice as treatment for children with CAE.\n\nApproximately 439 children, recruited over a 3-year period at 32 medical centers in the US, will take part in this 5-year study. Participants will be randomly given one of the 3 common CAE treatments-ethosuximide, lamotrigine, or valproic acid-and will make regular visits to a clinic every 1 to 3 months for approximately 2 years. During the visits, participants will undergo regular testing to determine if the medicine is working, to watch for side effects, and to help researchers learn more about the responses to these medicines. In addition, researchers hope to develop methods that may be used in the future to help choose the best medicine for each individual diagnosed with CAE.\n\nAlso included in the study will be pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics research. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes drugs. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic determinants of the response to drugs. Knowledge gained from this study may lead to individualized treatment for children with CAE, and may also be beneficial for other pediatric and adult seizure disorders."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Childhood Absence Epilepsy", "Petit Mal Epilepsy", "Epilepsy", "Seizures"], "keywords": ["childhood absence epilepsy", "CAE", "petit mal epilepsy", "epilepsy", "seizures", "ethosuximide", "lamotrigine", "valproic acid"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 453, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Ethosuximide", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Ethosuximide\n\nFrequency and Duration: twice a day, every day for the duration of the study treatment\n\nFormulation: Two formulations were used (actual formulation used was dependent on the patient's weight and ability to swallow): 250mg Zarontin capsules OR 250 mg/5 mL Zarontin syrup\n\nDosing: Ethosuximide was titrated in predetermined increments every 1-2 weeks during a 16-week titration period.
