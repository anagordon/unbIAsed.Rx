The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.\n\nTakeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of alogliptin in combination with metformin in individually who are inadequately controlled on metformin alone.\n\nIndividuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a screening visit and up to 14 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is anticipated to be about 34 weeks (or 8.5 months)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes Mellitus"], "keywords": ["Glucose Metabolism Disorder", "Dysmetabolic
