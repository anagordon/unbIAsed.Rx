This pilot will test and validate vital elements and procedures including: 1) enrolling persons with ADRD on Meals on Wheels (MOW) programs' waiting lists to receive one of the two types of meals; 2) recruiting a subsample of participants and caregivers to participate in telephone interviews; 3) extracting and transferring program data to Brown University; 4) linking participant data with Medicare and nursing home assessment data. Persons with ADRD receiving meals and their caregivers will be recruited to pilot interview guides. The interviews will provide important process and mechanistic information about the experiences receiving meals and participants' outcomes.", "detailedDescription": "236 individuals on the waiting list at three MOW programs (Neighborly Senior Services in Clearwater, Florida; Visiting Nurse Association of Texas in Dallas, Texas; Meals on Wheels - San Antonio in San Antonio, Texas) will be randomized to one of the following modes of delivery: 1) meals that are delivered multiple times per week by a MOW program volunteer or paid driver and includes socialization and a wellness check or 2) frozen meals that are mailed to participants' homes every two weeks. Persons with ADRD receiving meals and their caregivers will be recruited to pilot interview guides.\n\nThe primary aim is to test and validate procedures to recruit participants with ADRD and evaluate their outcomes in partnership with MOW programs. The study also aims to characterize differences in the processes and potential mechanisms contributing to outcomes between the two modes of meal delivery among older adults with ADRD. The qualitative interviews with participants and their caregivers will provide important process and mechanistic information about the experiences receiving meals and participants' outcomes."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dementia"], "keywords": ["Nutrition", "Homebound", "Food insecurity"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "This is a Phase 1 pilot feasibility study that uses an embedded, pragmatic randomized clinical trial design.", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 243, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Daily Meals", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "A lunch-time meal delivered to participants' homes multiple times per week with wellness check and socialization.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Daily home meal delivery"]}, {"label": "Frozen, Drop-shipped Meals", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "10 frozen meals that are mailed to participants every two weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Bi-weekly frozen meal home delivery"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Bi-weekly frozen meal home delivery", "description": "All participants randomized to this arm will receive 10 frozen meals that are mailed to their home every two weeks from a MOW vendor, TRIO foods.", "armGroupLabels": ["Frozen, Drop-shipped Meals"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Daily home meal delivery", "description": "All participants randomized to this arm will receive meals delivered to their home multiple times per week from a MOW program employee/volunteer with a wellness check and socialization.", "armGroupLabels": ["Daily Meals"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Time to Nursing Home Placement", "description": "We report the restricted mean survival time, which is the average time free from an event (i.e., nursing home placement) up until 180 days or death, whichever comes first.", "timeFrame": "6 months / 180 days"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* On MOW program waiting list\n* 66 years of age or older (to allow for Medicare enrollment and a one-year baseline look-back)\n* Self-reporting a diagnosis of memory loss, dementia, cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Residing in a service area where it is not possible to receive the daily-delivered meals.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "66 Years", "stdAges": ["OLDER_ADULT"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"overallOfficials": [{"name": "Kali S Thomas, PhD", "affiliation": "Brown University, School of Public Health", "role": "PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}], "locations": [{"facility": "Neighborly Senior Services", "city": "Clearwater", "state": "Florida", "zip": "33762", "country": "United States", "geoPoint": {"lat": 27.96585, "lon": -82.8001}}, {"facility": "Visiting Nurse Association of Texas", "city": "Dallas", "state": "Texas", "zip": "75247", "country": "United States", "geoPoint": {"lat": 32.78306, "lon": -96.80667}}, {"facility": "Meals on Wheels - San Antonio", "city": "San Antonio", "state": "Texas", "zip": "78229", "country": "United States", "geoPoint": {"lat": 29.42412, "lon": -98.49363}}]}, "referencesModule": {"seeAlsoLinks": [{"label": "Peer-reviewed paper describing the results from the qualitative sub-study", "url": "https://pilotfeasibilitystudies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40814-023-01302-5"}]}, "ipdSharingStatementModule": {"ipdSharing": "NO"}}, "resultsSection": {"participantFlowModule": {"preAssignmentDetails": "243 participants were enrolled in the trial.", "recruitmentDetails": "Participants at 3 home-delivered meals sites were identified based on 1) being on a waitlist 2) self-identifying as having dementia and 3) being age 66 years and older.
