It is intended for use in hospital and at home. It is not intended as a replacement for heart function; it is not life sustaining or life-supporting therapy. It does not preclude the use of other heart failure therapies, such as valve surgery, heart transplantation or LVAD.\n\nThe Sunshine Heart C-Pulse System is an implantable, non-blood contacting, non-obligatory, heart assist device.
