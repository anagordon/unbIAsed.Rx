Children will be ages 5-12, and must have two or more visits to any combination of the outpatient, Emergency Department (ED) or hospital setting in the past year for asthma exacerbations at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).\n\nThe study intervention will include daily automated medication reminders (either via text message or push reminder), an app to track daily medication use, and nominal incentives to promote daily controller use. Inhaled controller medication adherence and rescue medication use will be measured using electronic monitors affixed to the inhalers. Factors associated with differential adherence will be assessed using surveys administered during enrollment, the experiment interval (months 1 through 3), the observation interval (months 4 through 6), and study completion (months 12-13). Efficacy outcomes will include change in parent-reported asthma control and mean adherence to ICS between study arms during the experiment interval, as well as the observation interval.\n\nPatients will be considered fully enrolled when they fulfill the requirements of the Run-in period (sensor data uploaded to research platform AND text message receipt confirmed by caregiver) and are subsequently randomized."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Medication Adherence", "Asthma in Children"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 125, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Arm 1: Incentives, plus reminders & feedback (IRF)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "There will be a run-in period to determine eligibility for randomization and collect baseline adherence data (Month 0).\n\nDuring the \"Experiment\" period (Months 1-3), Arm 1 will receive the IRF intervention.\n\nDuring the \"Observation\" period (Months 4-6), all the arms will have continued daily ICS monitoring to assess enduring effects of each arm - no IRF.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Nominal Financial Incentives", "Other: Daily Adherence Reminders/Adherence Performance Feedback"]}, {"label": "Arm 2: Reminders & feedback ONLY", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "There will be a run-in period to determine eligibility for randomization and collect baseline adherence data (Month 0).\n\nDuring the \"Experiment\" period (Months 1-3), Arm 2 will receive ONLY reminders and feedback, without nominal financial incentives.\n\nDuring the \"Observation\" period (Months 4-6), all three arms will have continued daily ICS monitoring to assess enduring effects of each arm - no IRF.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Daily Adherence Reminders/Adherence Performance Feedback"]}, {"label": "Arm 3 (Control)", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "There will be a run-in period to determine eligibility for randomization and collect baseline adherence data (Month 0).\n\nDuring the \"Experiment\" period (Months 1-3), Arm 3 will not receive any component of the IRF intervention.\n\nDuring the \"Observation\" period (Months 4-6), all three arms will have continued daily ICS monitoring to assess enduring effects of each arm - no IRF."}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Nominal Financial Incentives", "description": "The nominal financial incentives will consist of fixed-ratio incentives for each inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) actuation (25 cents for children on 4 daily ICS doses and 50 cents for children on 2 daily doses), with a maximum of $1 per day.", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm 1: Incentives, plus reminders & feedback (IRF)"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Daily Adherence Reminders/Adherence Performance Feedback", "description": "Study participants will receive automated daily text message or push notification reminders and automated weekly feedback summarizing their adherence performance through Way to Health, a mobile health, electronic monitoring platform.", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm 1: Incentives, plus reminders & feedback (IRF)", "Arm 2: Reminders & feedback ONLY"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Mean Monthly Adherence to Inhaled Corticosteroid Regimen (Unadjusted)", "description": "Calculated as the mean daily proportion of prescribed doses taken by study month by study arm.
