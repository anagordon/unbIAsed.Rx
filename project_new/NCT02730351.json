Subjects will participate in up to eight study visits and have a follow up phone call approximately a week after the last clinic visit. Visits 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are evening visits that will be conducted between 5PM and 11PM. Visit 4 and Visit 7 are also evening visits that will begin between 5PM and 11PM and continue over a period of approximately 24 hours. Subjects will be required to attend three clinic visits during this 24-hour period. An exercise challenge (using a treadmill) will be conducted at Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 6 (after 23 hours of the first treatment dose in each Treatment Period); and at 12 and 23 hours post evening dose at Visits 4 and 7. Spirometry will be conducted at specified visits and prior to and after each exercise challenge.\n\nSubjects with symptomatic allergic rhinitis at Visit 1 (screening) may be treated for up to four weeks with intranasal corticosteroids followed by a repeat screening visit to determine eligibility prior to entry into the study.\n\nEligible subjects at visit 1 will complete a 4-week single blind run-in on FP 250 microgram (mcg) twice daily (BID), followed by 2-week double-blind Treatment Period 1 on randomized treatment, a 2-week single blind washout period on FP 250 mcg BID, 2-week double-blind Treatment Period 2 receiving the alternative treatment, and follow-up contact approximately 7-days after completing Treatment Period 2. The total duration of study participation is approximately 11 weeks; and up to 15 weeks for subjects with Symptomatic Allergic Rhinitis.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the protective effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 mcg once-daily compared with fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 mcg twice-daily against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adolescent and adult subjects aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma.\n\nELLIPTA, ACCUHALER, and DISKUS are registered trademarks of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Fluticasone furoate", "activity monitoring", "Vilanterol", "Cross-over", "exercise-induced bronchoconstriction", "exercise challenge", "double-dummy", "asthma", "spirometry", "fluticasone propionate"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 75, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "FF/VI 100/25 mcg + Placebo DISKUS\u00ae/ ACCUHALER\u00ae", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Randomised subjects will receive FF/VI 100/25 mcg once daily via ELLIPTA inhaler and placebo twice daily via DISKUS / ACCUHALER for 2 weeks in Period 1.
