The DPP has ended early demonstrating that lifestyle reduced diabetes onset by 58% and metformin reduced diabetes onset by 31%.\n\nDPPOS (2002-2013) is designed to take advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable DPP participants. This group of participants is nearly 50% minority and represents the largest at risk population ever studied. Clinically important research questions remain that focus on 1) durability of the prior DPP intervention, 2) determination of the clinical course of precisely known new onset diabetes, in particular regarding microvascular disease, CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis, 3) close examination of these topics in men vs women and in minority populations.\n\nThe major aims of DPPOS-3 (2014-2025) take advantage of the long-term randomized exposure of the study cohort to metformin and the aging of the DPPOS cohort. The metformin exposure and high degree of study retention and adherence (\\~85% of the DPPOS cohort continues to attend annual and mid-year visits) allows DPPOS-3 to examine the long-term effects of metformin on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer outcomes, outcomes of great clinical interest and import.", "detailedDescription": "The current DPPOS Executive Summary and protocol, as well as DPPOS protocol and lifestyle manuals and publications are available at: http://www.dppos.org"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes Mellitus", "Cancer", "CVD"], "keywords": ["DPP", "IGT", "Prediabetes", "Type 2 diabetes", "Macrovascular disease", "Microvascular disease", "Lifestyle", "Metformin", "Obesity"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE", "maskingDescription": "Open label phase for metformin"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 2779, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "1 Original Lifestyle", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "randomized to unmasked Intensive Lifestyle during the DPP and offered Intensive Lifestyle Group Session, DPPOS Group Lifestyle plus DPPOS Boost Lifestyle sessions in DPPOS Phase 1 and 2", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: DPPOS Group Lifestyle", "Behavioral: DPPOS Boost Lifestyle", "Behavioral: Intensive Lifestyle Group Session"]}, {"label": "2 Original Metformin", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "randomized to the masked metformin treatment group during DPP and continued open label in DPPOS.
