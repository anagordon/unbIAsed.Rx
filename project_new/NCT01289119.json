Diabetes is also associated with macrovascular complications including cardiovascular disease (heart disease), stroke and peripheral vascular disease (narrowing or blockage of blood vessels). These complications are associated with reduced quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nTakeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for improvement of glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nEvaluations of alogliptin and its clinical efficacy have been conducted in multiple countries including the United States and Japan. This study will be conducted as a multi-center clinical trial in order to validate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin on type 2 diabetes population within Asia.\n\nParticipants who qualified for the study were stratified into 1 of the 3 therapy groups based upon their background antidiabetic therapy before being randomized 1:1 to receive either alogliptin 25 mg once daily or matching placebo once daily.\n\n* Monotherapy group - patients who had been treated with diet and exercise for at least 2 months prior to screening.\n* Add-on to metformin therapy group - patients who had been treated with metformin for at least 3 months and at a stable dose (\u22651000 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks prior to screening.\n* Add-on to pioglitazone therapy group - patients who had been treated with a stable dose of pioglitazone alone or in combination with metformin at a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to screening."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"], "keywords": ["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "Drug Therapy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 506, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Participants received alogliptin placebo-matching tablets, orally once daily for up to 16 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo to alogliptin"]}, {"label": "Alogliptin Monotherapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants received alogliptin 25 mg tablets, orally, once daily for up to 16 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Alogliptin"]}, {"label": "Metformin", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Participants continued to receive their stable dose of metformin (\u22651000 mg/day) and also received alogliptin placebo-matching tablets, orally once daily for up to 16 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo to alogliptin", "Drug: Metformin"]}, {"label": "Metformin + Alogliptin Add-on Therapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants continued to receive their stable dose of metformin (\u22651000 mg/day) and also received alogliptin 25 mg tablets, orally, once daily for up to 16 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Alogliptin", "Drug: Metformin"]}, {"label": "Pioglitazone", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Participants continued to receive their stable dose of pioglitazone with or without metformin, and also received alogliptin placebo-matching tablets, orally once daily for up to 16 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo to alogliptin", "Drug: Pioglitazone"]}, {"label": "Pioglitazone + Alogliptin Add-on Therapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants continued to receive their stable dose of pioglitazone with or without metformin and also received alogliptin, 25 mg tablets orally once daily for up to 16 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Alogliptin", "Drug: Pioglitazone"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Alogliptin", "description": "Alogliptin tablets", "armGroupLabels": ["Alogliptin Monotherapy", "Metformin + Alogliptin Add-on Therapy", "Pioglitazone + Alogliptin Add-on Therapy"], "otherNames": ["SYR-322"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo to alogliptin", "description": "Alogliptin placebo-matching tablets.", "armGroupLabels": ["Metformin", "Pioglitazone", "Placebo"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Metformin", "description": "Stable metformin dose", "armGroupLabels": ["Metformin", "Metformin + Alogliptin Add-on Therapy"], "otherNames": ["Fortamet", "Glucophage", "Glumetza"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Pioglitazone", "description": "Stable pioglitazone dose", "armGroupLabels": ["Pioglitazone", "Pioglitazone + Alogliptin Add-on Therapy"], "otherNames": ["Actos"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)", "description": "The change from Baseline in HbA1c (the concentration of glucose bound to hemoglobin as a percent of the absolute maximum that can be bound) collected at Week 16.
