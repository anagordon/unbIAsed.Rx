The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study comparing the combined supplementation of fish oil and glutamine with placebo in patients with stable heart failure. 30 patients with heart failure will be randomized to either receiving 6.5 g fish oil/d and 8 g glutamine/d (n=15) or placebo (n=15) for 90 days. The primary outcome in this study is the change in muscle functional capacity measured as changes in maximum muscle strength and fatigability, peak VO2 and exercise time after supplementation. A secondary outcome is the measurement of systemic and local markers of inflammation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure", "Skeletal Muscle Function", "Metabolism", "Inflammation", "Glutamine", "Fish oil", "Muscle Function"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2", "PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 31, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "The placebo for fish oil will be safflower oil.
