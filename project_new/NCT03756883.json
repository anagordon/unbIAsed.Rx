The subject may enter the placebo run-in period prior to receipt of test results at Screening, if not yet received from the clinical laboratory, but should be evaluated by the Investigator for continued participation once test results are received.\n\n   Women of childbearing potential must agree to the use of a reliable method of contraception (e.g., total abstinence, intrauterine device, a double-barrier method, oral, transdermal, injected or implanted non- or hormonal contraceptive), throughout the study. A sterile sexual partner is not considered an adequate form of birth control.

Able to discontinue use of their asthma medications during the run-in period and for the remainder of the study.\n10. Able to replace current short-acting beta-agonists \\[SABAs\\] with the study supplied salbutamol/albuterol rescue inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study.
