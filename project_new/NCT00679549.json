The annual cost of CHF in 2005 was $ 27.9 billion, large percentage of which is the cost of hospitalizations for exacerbation of CHF. Half of patients with CHF have some form of sleep apnea, and most of them go undiagnosed. Patients with CHF and OSA benefit from treatment with CPAP as an outpatient. The society can benefit from developing recommendations for approaching sleep apnea in the hospitalized CHF patient, which may shorten length of stay, improve functional status of discharged patient, and reduce rehospitalizations.", "detailedDescription": "Target population:\n\nPatients admitted to the OSU Heart Hospital with ADHF routinely undergo a cardiorespiratory sleep study to identify OSA. Patients with ADHF who are newly diagnosed with OSA during the same hospital stay are eligible for this study.\n\nEnrollment:\n\nGiven the presence of significant previously unrecognized OSA in 62% of patients hospitalized with ADHF, we expect to need to screen 270 patient volunteers to recruit 170 patients with OSA.\n\nEligibility for randomization: The criteria for ADHF is admission diagnosis of heart failure; a chief complaint of dyspnea; and ejection fraction of 45% or less. Additionally, elevated left ventricular pressure as indicated by at least one sign and one symptom of volume overload (pedal edema, crackles, consistent chest X-ray, increased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, or elevated BNP level) is required \\[46\\]."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure", "Obstructive Sleep Apnea", "Heart Failure, Congestive"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure", "Obstructive Sleep Apnea", "OSA", "CHF", "Sleep apnea", "CHD"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 154, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "DEVICE", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Provided CPAP as an inpatient", "interventionNames": ["Device: CPAP Therapy"]}, {"label": "Control", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "No device provided"}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "CPAP Therapy", "description": "CPAP therapy is provided as an inpatient.", "armGroupLabels": ["DEVICE"], "otherNames": ["CPAP Device"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)", "description": "Using the modified Simpson method.
