We will compare the impact of Asthma Link deployed in 2 pediatric practice sites versus Enhanced usual care deployed in 2 comparator sites, with 18 parent-child dyads enrolled per site (N=72 dyads).\n\nPrimary trial outcomes will be participant recruitment, retention, and intervention fidelity. Secondary trial outcomes will be differences in the frequency of asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, courses of oral corticosteroids, spirometry values, medication adherence and school absences between intervention and enhanced usual care sites at 3, 6 and 12 month follow up. Additionally we will assess process outcomes (acceptability, adoption, costs, sustainability)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Childhood Asthma"], "keywords": ["asthma", "childhood asthma", "stakeholder engagement", "medication adherence", "school-supervised asthma therapy", "real-world", "pragmatic trial"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 66, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Asthma Link", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Site providers will be trained to efficiently discuss school-supervised medication administration with families and school nurses.
