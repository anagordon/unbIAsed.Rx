The investigators will compare young adults who use 'Smoke Sense,' an EPA-developed smart phone application (app), with young adults who use the app plus engage in preventive activities, with young adults who do not use the app. Study aims are to:\n\n1. Establish the feasibility (recruitment, enrollment, retention rates), acceptability (intervention engagement, fidelity, usability, attitude) and barriers and facilitators of adopting the technology of the Smoke Sense interventions and use of portable devices in young adults with asthma;\n2. Explore the preliminary impact of the Smoke Sense interventions on lung function and asthma control. These primary outcomes will be assessed using objective measures (spirometry) and validated, self-report tools.\n\n   Secondary outcomes will be anxiety, exposure reduction behaviors (e.g. stayed indoors, wore a mask), and symptom mitigating behaviors (use of medication, unscheduled health care appointments), measured via self-report and a Global Positioning System device. Outcome by group will be summarized. Preliminary evidence of treatment effect and its variance will be examined for a future clinical trial;\n3. Explore potential mediators (medication adherence, self-management skills, stress) and moderators (asthma severity/control) of the interventions to asthma outcomes. The long-term goal is to minimize asthma exacerbations from exposure to wildfire smoke.\n\nThe long-term goal of the study is to minimize asthma exacerbations from exposure to wildfire smoke.", "detailedDescription": "Exposure to unprecedented levels of wildfire smoke is increasing cardiopulmonary mortality and is especially catastrophic in people with asthma. Little evidence exists on the effectiveness of air quality (AQ) alerts on objective measures of risk reduction behavior and health outcomes. Evidence shows that young adults are less likely to adhere to AQ alerts than older adults, yet young adulthood is a time when habits are formed in chronic illness management. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Smoke Sense smart phone application (app) is an innovative risk reduction intervention based on the health belief model and theory of planned behavior. The app invites users to record their smoke observations and health symptoms, play educational trivia games, earn badges, and explore what other users are reporting. Smoke Sense connects AQ exposure data with users' symptoms, thus framing risk reduction messages as personally relevant. Although Smoke Sense has almost 25,000 users, its impact on health outcomes has not been tested. Preliminary data suggests that users' engagement in health protective behaviors was driven in response to symptoms rather than as preventive courses of action. In a high-risk asthma population, prevention is paramount. Smoke Sense Plus is an intervention that builds on the Smoke Sense app, with value-added activities, such as notifying participants to review their asthma action plan, monitoring lung function weekly via mobile spirometry and subscribing to a social network to share strategies to minimize exposure. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of the Smoke Sense interventions among young adults with asthma and pilot test the interventions compared to a control group. Sixty young adults aged 18-26 with asthma will be recruited through local universities. They will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups for a 2-month study period during wildfire season. Study aims are to:\n\n1. Establish the feasibility (recruitment, enrollment, retention rates), acceptability (intervention engagement, fidelity, usability, attitude) and barriers and facilitators of adopting the technology of the Smoke Sense interventions and use of portable devices in young adults with asthma;51\n2.

Badges are awarded for accomplishments within the app to promote certain desired behaviors: completing a user profile, launching the app weekly to check local AQ, reporting smoke and symptom observations, expanding AQ knowledge with AQ lessons, and exploring the map. Finally, participants can engage with other users by viewing cumulative statistics of symptoms and smoke observations.", "deathsNumAffected": 0, "deathsNumAtRisk": 22, "seriousNumAffected": 0, "seriousNumAtRisk": 22, "otherNumAffected": 0, "otherNumAtRisk": 22}, {"id": "EG002", "title": "Smoke Sense Plus", "description": "Smoke Sense Plus: Participants randomized to the Smoke Sense Plus intervention will be asked to do everything that the Smoke Sense intervention group does on a weekly basis, as well as: 1) Receive weekly push notifications that remind them to, for example, review their asthma action plan, refill any expired medications, take their daily controller medication, identify a clean air space in their home and community, 2) Monitor their lung function weekly via mobile spirometry, and 3) Subscribe to a social network to share strategies to minimize exposure.", "deathsNumAffected": 0, "deathsNumAtRisk": 23, "seriousNumAffected": 0, "seriousNumAtRisk": 23, "otherNumAffected": 0, "otherNumAtRisk": 23}]}, "moreInfoModule": {"limitationsAndCaveats": {"description": "37 participants recorded both ACT and FEV1 measures that were within the study visit window (3 days from scheduled) and within 1 day of each other at both baseline and week 8.
