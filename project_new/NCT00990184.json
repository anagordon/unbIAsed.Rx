Subsequently it was observed that patients with type 2 diabetes receiving this medication had improved glucose control. However, the mechanism(s) by which it lowers glucose concentrations has not been determined.\n\nGlucose metabolism is enhanced following oral nutrient ingestion by the action of the incretin hormones. The two major incretin hormones are the peptides glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), which are released from the intestinal tract wall in response to a meal. Of these two peptides, GLP-1 appears to be more important in regulating glucose metabolism. In the presence of elevated plasma glucose, GLP-1 promotes insulin release from the \u00df-cells of the pancreas. GLP-1 also suppresses glucagon release, and thereby inhibits hepatic glucose output. Administration of GLP-1 by infusion or by subcutaneous injection has been shown to improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetic patients.\n\nThe purpose of this study is therefore to determine in a cohort of individuals with prediabetes, who have an elevated fasting plasma glucose and are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, whether the glucose lowering properties of colesevelam occur by it improving insulin sensitivity, islet \u00df-cell function or both. Further, by assessing the effect of colesevelam on incretin hormone release, it will be possible to determine whether any improvement in islet \u00df-cell function is due to enhanced incretin stimulation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Impaired Fasting Glucose", "Prediabetes"], "keywords": ["Impaired Fasting Glucose", "PreDiabetes"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 21, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Colesevelam Hydrochloride", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Colesevelam", "Other: placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Colesevelam", "description": "colesevelam HCl 3.75 g once daily orally with the evening meal", "armGroupLabels": ["Colesevelam Hydrochloride"], "otherNames": ["colesevelam HCl"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "placebo", "description": "tablet (s) orally given with evening meal", "armGroupLabels": ["Colesevelam Hydrochloride"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Acute Insulin Response (AIRg) to Intravenous Glucose", "description": "Increase in insulin following glucose injection.
