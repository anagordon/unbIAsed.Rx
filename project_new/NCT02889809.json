This is a randomised, single-blind (run-in period)/double-blind (treatment period), parallel group, placebo controlled, multicentre study to assess the effect of once daily (OD) inhaled fluticasone furoate (FF) 50 microgram (mcg) on growth velocity in prepubertal asthmatic children on a background therapy of open-label montelukast. This study will be conducted over a total duration of approximately 76 weeks: 16-week run-in period (single-blind placebo inhaler), 52-week double-blind treatment period (inhaled FF 50 mcg /placebo administered OD in the morning for 52 weeks) and 8-week follow-up period. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the magnitude of effect (with a level of precision) on growth velocity of prepubertal asthmatic paediatric subjects (aged 5 to \\<9 years) following administration of OD inhaled FF 50 mcg for one year.
