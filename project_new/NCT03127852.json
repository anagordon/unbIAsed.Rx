The purpose of this study is to evaluate an UHN-built remote monitoring system for patients with complex chronic conditions called Medly. Patients with complex chronic conditions will be provided with a mobile phone and commercial home medical devices, such as a blood pressure monitor and weight scale. The measurements from the medical devices will be automatically sent to the mobile phone, and from there to a data server at the hospital for analysis and storage. Both clinicians and patients will be able to access these data and will be sent alerts by the system if the measurements are outside of the normal range.
