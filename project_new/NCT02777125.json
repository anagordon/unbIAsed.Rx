There is also supporting data that the breath actuated nebulizers are also more effective than small volume nebulizers. The effectiveness of breath actuated nebulization compared to MDI for treating asthma exacerbations is less well defined.\n\nMetered dose inhalers with spacers are more readily available to the general population, are easily transportable and do not require a power source. Demonstrating equal effectiveness of albuterol delivery systems for treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations would enable physicians to confidently utilize clinical encounters as opportunities to educate families on management of asthma exacerbations using their home appliance."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["pediatrics", "metered dose inhalers", "breath actuated nebulizers"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 980, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Albuterol by Metered Dose Inhaler", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Albuterol administered via MDI and spacer device with weight and severity based dosing.
