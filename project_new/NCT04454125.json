Poorly controlled asthma is a major cause of suffering, school absences, loss of caregiver productivity, and healthcare costs (estimated as \\~$80 billion/year). Over half of children on controller medication are not well controlled, due to environmental exposures, non-adherence, or true non-response to treatment. Outdoor air pollution is a known trigger of asthma. Although sound health policies are the best long-term approaches to reduce the harmful effects of air pollution, exposure avoidance is needed until \"clean air\" is ensured through effective legislation. Despite this, healthcare providers infrequently provide pollution exposure advice to children with asthma. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors air pollution and reports a daily Air Quality Index (AQI) that is easy to use and available in most metropolitan areas. Practical recommendations regarding outdoor activity can be based on AQI levels. Despite this, AQI-based recommendations are rarely addressed in asthma action plans (AAP). No pediatric study has assessed the addition of the AQI to AAP to reduce asthma morbidity. This proposal seeks to recruit a pilot cohort of 40 children with asthma. Using this cohort, the investigators will test the hypotheses that (1) the addition of the AQI to AAP will reduce asthma exacerbations and (2) the addition of the AQI to AAP will improve asthma symptom control \\& quality of life in children with asthma. The inclusion of the AQI onto asthma action plans is novel in clinical asthma care; its wide availability would make large-scale implementation feasible. The investigators expect this low-cost and low-tech intervention will have a positive impact in reducing asthma morbidity. Given that 1 out of every 12 children in the U.S. has asthma, this is relevant to health care professionals, parents, and public health practitioners.\n\nOptional, the investigators will collect nasal epithelial cells for use in future genomic/epigenetic studies.\n\nAdditionally, 40 parents/guardians of the children were also recruited to complete a baseline parental knowledge and usage of the AQI questionnaire administered at the randomization visit. This was originally listed as a secondary outcome however was removed during reporting of results as parental knowledge is not a true clinical trial outcome. Also, the secondary outcome of baseline child AQI usage (checking AQI) was changed to reflect this was a measure collected at all study visits and the secondary measure of physical activity was added."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma", "Asthma in Children"], "keywords": ["Air Quality Index (AQI)", "Childhood asthma exacerbations"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "40 child will be 1:1 randomization by age groups 8-12 years, 13-17 years.", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE", "maskingDescription": "Unblinded"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 40, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Routine Care", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Other: Routine care"]}, {"label": "AQI Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: AQI intervention"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "AQI intervention", "description": "The intervention arm will receive AQI education, an asthma action plan containing AQI information and recommendations, and will be required to demonstrate ability to check AQI (either via airnow.gov website or downloaded AirNow smartphone app).", "armGroupLabels": ["AQI Intervention"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Routine care", "description": "The routine care arm will be provided with general AQI education and an asthma action plan not containing AQI information.", "armGroupLabels": ["Routine Care"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Participants With at Least One Moderate or Severe Asthma Exacerbation Over Time", "description": "Moderate and severe asthma exacerbations were captured via questionnaire administered monthly for up to 6 months.
