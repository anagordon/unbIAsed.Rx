While the effect of right ventricular (RV) failure early after pump implantation, and its effect on outcome has been extensively studied, the effects of late RV failure on exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL) has been sparsely described. Thus the purpose of this study is to examine RV function and the association to exercise capacity in CF-LVAD patients.", "detailedDescription": "When pharmacological therapy becomes insufficient in advanced end-stage heart failure (HF) transplantation remains the gold standard of therapies. However, due to a severe lack of donor organs, mechanical circulatory support is an alternative option for some eligible patients. Mechanical circulatory support in the form of a CF-LVAD is a pump supporting the left ventricle by pumping blood from the apex to the ascending aortae. Implantation with a CF-LVAD increases survival and improves quality of life, but peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) remains severely reduced post-implant. Complex central and peripheral hallmarks of heart failure attribute to the continued work intolerance. Furthermore a fixed CF-LVAD pump speed prevents adequate circulatory support during strenuous exercise. The effects of late right ventricular (RV) failure on exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL) is, however, unknown and the purpose of this study is to examine RV function and the association to exercise capacity in CF-LVAD patients."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 15, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "1 arm study: CCT estimated right ventricular function.", "type": "OTHER", "description": "By use of Cardiac computed tomography, the ejection faction of the right ventricle will be visualized and measured in all participants.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Cardiac Computed tomography"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Cardiac Computed tomography", "armGroupLabels": ["1 arm study: CCT estimated right ventricular function."]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Peak Oxygen Uptake", "description": "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) measuring peak oxygen uptake in ml/kg/min.", "timeFrame": "Day 1"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Right Ventricular Function (RVEF) During Exercise", "description": "Right ventricular function during exercise was estimated by use of contrast enhanced cardiac computed tomography.", "timeFrame": "Day 1"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Outpatients from Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.\n* Age \u2265 18 years.\n* Ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n* Signed informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unstable patients with the need for intravenous inotropic therapy.\n* CF-LVAD implantation less than one month ago.\n* eGFR \\< 45 ml/min.\n* Contrast allergy.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "maximumAge": "100 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"locations": [{"facility": "University Hospital Rigshospitalet.", "city": "Copenhagen", "zip": "2100", "country": "Denmark", "geoPoint": {"lat": 55.67594, "lon": 12.56553}}]}}, "resultsSection": {"participantFlowModule": {"groups": [{"id": "FG000", "title": "1 Arm Study: CCT Estimated Right Ventricular Function.", "description": "Fifteen patients with HeartMate (HM) II or III underwent echocardiography and maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test.
