Studies show that reduction of SERCA2a in failing ventricle is a key factor in depression of contraction, and that restoration of SERCA2a levels can improve function to near normal levels. The vector will be delivered during a cardiac catheterisation procedure by a 10-minute infusion into the coronary arteries.\n\nMyocardial tissue is obtained at the time of LVAD placement, as a routine part of device implantation. Further samples will be obtained when the heart is transplanted or the LVAD removed. Measures of tissue inflammation as well as efficacy of gene transfer will be made by comparing these two samples. Recovery of contractile function of the heart will be assessed during attempts to wean patients from the LVAD using standard protocols.\n\nThe results will be assessed in conjunction with two companion studies which will start earlier in the US, one performing SERCA2a gene transfer with the same vector, but delivered by direct injection into the myocardium during LVAD insertion, and one using AAV1-CMV-SERCA2a delivered percutaneously in heart failure patients.
