During development of asthma the presence of oxidative stress has been related to susceptibility and severity of the disease, thus making the use of antioxidant adjuvant therapy with lipoic acid (LA) an interesting treatment option.\n2. Study design. A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled parallel study\n3. Methods. Participants and interventions: 55 patients with mild to moderate asthma from Hospital Civil \"Juan I.
