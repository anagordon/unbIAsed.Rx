The study will be used to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Budesonide/Formoterol Fumarate combination (BFF) 400/12 micrograms (mcg) single capsule inhaler (NEUMOTEROL 400) compared with BFF 320/9 mcg SYMBICORT Forte TURBUHALER\u00ae inhaler.\n\nThe population for this study will be adult subjects (\\>=18 and \\<=80 years) with a diagnosis of asthma who have a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40% to 85% of the predicted normal value, and are receiving a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroid inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist (LABA) prior to screening.\n\nThe study will consist of six phases: Prescreening, Screening/Run-in (4 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (4 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (4 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 17 weeks. There will be up to 6 study visits and a follow-up telephone call.\n\nPre-screening Visit will allow subjects who had recent asthma medication changes to be stabilized prior to Screening.

The dose of NEUMOTEROL 400 (400/12 mcg) and SYMBICORT Forte (320/9 mcg) will be one inhalation BID, and each treatment will be given to all subjects for 4 weeks (with a 4-week Washout Period between treatments).\n\nThe study will include 300 subjects for screening so that at least 210 will be randomised and a minimum of 168 subjects complete the study/are evaluable.
