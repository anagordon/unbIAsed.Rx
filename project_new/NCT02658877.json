Understanding the response of specific innate immune effector cells in the lung can provide clues to these questions. Investigators will use non-invasive measures of a discrete cell population to examine the downstream effects of omalizumab treatment in the lung. Information derived from these studies will help clarify mechanisms of action of omalizumab and help identify potential tools for patient endotyping and stratification for therapeutic interventions.", "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, 16-week intervention study to show feasibility and proof of concept. Analysis of whole induced sputum is under development for endotyping for asthma, allowing sampling of rare cells from conducting airways, repeated sampling, and cell-specific detailed genomic evaluation. Investigators have developed a novel technique to simultaneously enrich innate immune cells from sputum. This technique allows for in situ analyses of sputum-derived human bronchial epithelial cells (sHBEC). The non-invasive nature of the technique provides a unique tool for in vivo human studies."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Xolair", "corticosteroids", "asthma", "long-acting beta-agonists"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 3, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Omalizumab", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Omalizumab"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Omalizumab", "description": "Omalizumab will be dosed according to dosing and U.S. administration guidelines for omalizumab.
