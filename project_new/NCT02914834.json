The investigators long term goal is pain and symptom management resulting in improved functional status and quality of life for men and women with stable angina, chest pain, and chest discomfort. This study will include 69 community dwelling men and women with a medically confirmed diagnosis of stable angina, chest pain which includes non-ischemic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or chest discomfort whose pain and associated symptoms have not been completely controlled with guideline-directed medical management. The investigators will use a randomized attention control design with 13 men and women assigned to initial acupuncture and 13 to control. Participants in the experimental group will receive a standardized acupuncture point prescription two treatments per week, for 5 weeks.
