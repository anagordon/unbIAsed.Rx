The study consists of 3 periods: Observation period (from the time of obtaining consent to the start of study treatment), Treatment period, and Follow-up period (from 24 hours after the initiation of study treatment \\[discontinuation\\] to 30 days after the initiation of study treatment). The participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups: 2+0.005 group, 1+0.01 group and 2+0.01 group. The treatment period consists of treatment with bolus injection (over 1 minute) followed by intravenous infusion (over 24 hours: Period 1 \\[fixed-dose period\\] of 3 hours and Period 2 \\[flexible-dose period\\] of 21 hours).The study will be conducted stepwise and hence, initially participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following 2 groups: 1+0.01 group and 2+0.005 group. Participants will receive nesiritide at an initial dose of 0.005 or 0.01 microgram per kilogram per minute (mcg/kg/min), and the dose escalation of 0.005 mcg/kg/min per dose will be conducted every 3 hours up to maximum of 0.03 mcg/kg/min in Period 2. Safety data of at least 5 participants will be assessed for each group, and after confirming the safety of 2 groups, the participants will be assigned to third group of nesiritide 2 microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg) +0.01 mcg/kg/min. Then participants will be followed up to a maximum of 30 days after the initiation of study treatment, in follow-up period. Participants will primarily be evaluated for the effect of nesiritide on hemodynamic parameters such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), or if it is unmeasurable then it will be complemented with pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure (PADP).
