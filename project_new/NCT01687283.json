The clinic visit will be arranged at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks during study treatment. If the subjects meet the criteria of pre-defined asthma control at treatment 4 weeks or 8 weeks, they will have one chance to be treated with the half dose of study drug. 2 weeks after completion of study treatment or after early withdrawal from study, the follow-up visit will be performed to assess the post-treatment adverse events. The primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the 12 week treatment period. Safety assessments include adverse events, vital signs, oral and oropharyngeal candidiasis, hematological, biochemical tests), 24-hour urinary cortisol and 12-lead ECG.
