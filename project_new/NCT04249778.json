More than 40% of patients with established heart failure (HF) have diabetes.\n\nDapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2-i) indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D mellitus. Treatment with SGLT2-i has been shown to reduce both heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in patients with established heart disease. However, the time of initiation of SGLT2-i therapy has not been evaluated in patients with HF. This study will be the first trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin treatment in preventing hospital re-admissions, ER visits, urgent clinic visits, and death in patients with and without T2D after hospital admission for heart failure. In addition, the impact of treatment on HF symptoms quality of life, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus placebo will be evaluated. The results of this study have great potential to impact and facilitate care and to change current clinical guidelines in the management of patients with heart failure.\n\nPatients with and without diabetes who have acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) will be randomized to take either dapagliflozin or placebo daily for 26 weeks, beginning at the time of discharge from from the hospital."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure", "Diabetes"], "keywords": ["hospitalization", "mortality", "time of initiation of therapy", "quality of life", "cost-effectiveness", "dapagliflozin", "clinical trial", "diabetes"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 105, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Dapagliflozin", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients admitted with exacerbation of chronic heart failure by clinical and radiologic features randomized to receive 10 mg of dapagliflozin, once daily for 26 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Dapagliflozin"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Patients admitted with exacerbation of chronic heart failure by clinical and radiologic features randomized to receive a placebo to match 10 mg of dapagliflozin, once daily for 26 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Dapagliflozin", "description": "Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
