Music and Memory is a personalized music program that uses portable music players to deliver individualized music to people with dementia at times when agitated behaviors are likely.\n\n\\*\\*This funding mechanism sponsored two parallel trials with different implementation strategies. In this trial, nursing home staff identify the music a resident with dementia may have preferred when s/he was young by asking family members and testing individual songs with the resident. Details of the second parallel trial conducted under this funding mechanism are registered under \"R33AG057451_part2.\"\\*\\*\n\nThe aims of this study are: 1. To use a train-the-trainer model to implement the intervention with ongoing monitoring of the program's adoption and acceptance by nursing home residents with dementia; 2. To estimate the impact of Music and Memory on agitated and aggressive behaviors; and 3.

In addition, they include an individual-level effect to account for multiple observations for the same resident, and a facility level effect to account for variability in the outcomes for individuals residing in the same nursing homes. To address baseline differences in the proportion of individuals at each level of the ordinal outcomes between treatment and control groups, we report the marginal time by intervention interaction. We will refer to this estimand as the marginal interaction effect (MIE), which is sometimes known as the Difference in Differences estimand."}]}]}, "adverseEventsModule": {"frequencyThreshold": "0", "timeFrame": "8-month data collection window at facility", "eventGroups": [{"id": "EG000", "title": "Music and Memory", "description": "Music and Memory is a personalized music program in which nursing home staff provide people with dementia with music playlists tailored to their personal history of music preferences.", "deathsNumAffected": 37, "deathsNumAtRisk": 532, "seriousNumAffected": 0, "seriousNumAtRisk": 532, "otherNumAffected": 0, "otherNumAtRisk": 532}, {"id": "EG001", "title": "Usual Care", "description": "Usual care for managing agitated and/or aggressive behaviors in the nursing home setting.", "deathsNumAffected": 31, "deathsNumAtRisk": 541, "seriousNumAffected": 0, "seriousNumAtRisk": 541, "otherNumAffected": 0, "otherNumAtRisk": 541}]}, "moreInfoModule": {"certainAgreement": {"piSponsorEmployee": false, "restrictiveAgreement": false}, "pointOfContact": {"title": "Ellen McCreedy, PhD", "organization": "Brown University", "email": "Ellen_McCreedy@brown.edu", "phone": "401-863-7345"}}}, "documentSection": {"largeDocumentModule": {"largeDocs": [{"typeAbbrev": "Prot_SAP", "hasProtocol": true, "hasSap": true, "hasIcf": false, "label": "Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan", "date": "2021-11-17", "uploadDate": "2022-10-30T14:12", "filename": "Prot_SAP_000.pdf", "size": 602747}]}}, "derivedSection": {"miscInfoModule": {"versionHolder": "2024-06-24"}, "conditionBrowseModule": {"meshes": [{"id": "D000000544", "term": "Alzheimer Disease"}], "ancestors": [{"id": "D000003704", "term": "Dementia"}, {"id": "D000001927", "term": "Brain Diseases"}, {"id": "D000002493", "term": "Central Nervous System Diseases"}, {"id": "D000009422", "term": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"id": "D000024801", "term": "Tauopathies"}, {"id": "D000019636", "term": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, {"id": "D000019965", "term": "Neurocognitive Disorders"}, {"id": "D000001523", "term": "Mental Disorders"}], "browseLeaves": [{"id": "M6904", "name": "Dementia", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "M3885", "name": "Alzheimer Disease", "asFound": "Alzheimer's Disease", "relevance": "HIGH"}, {"id": "M5204", "name": "Brain Diseases", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "M5742", "name": "Central Nervous System Diseases", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "M23002", "name": "Tauopathies", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "M21558", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "M21836", "name": "Neurocognitive Disorders", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "M4815", "name": "Mental Disorders", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "M14473", "name": "Psychotic Disorders", "relevance": "LOW"}, {"id": "T2192", "name": "Familial Alzheimer Disease", "relevance": "LOW"}], "browseBranches": [{"abbrev": "BC10", "name": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"abbrev": "BXM", "name": "Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}, {"abbrev": "All", "name": "All Conditions"}, {"abbrev": "Rare", "name": "Rare Diseases"}]}}, "hasResults": true}
