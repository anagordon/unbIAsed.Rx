The sleep complaint should be present on most days for at least 3 months.\n* Additional inclusion criteria include: a subjective TST \\<6.5 h and a subjective SL \\> 45 min per night; a mean LPS \\>20 min over 2 consecutive nights by polysomnography (neither night could have been \\<15 min); a habitual bedtime between 10 PM and 1 AM; and ISI score \\> 10 (based on 0-4 scale). LPS is defined as amount of time to the first 10 minutes of continuous sleep.\n* Asthma will be diagnosed based on suggestive clinical history and either\n\n  * airway hyperresponsiveness indicated by a 20% or greater decrease in FEV1 in response to inhalation of methacholine at 8 mg/mL or less\n  * bronchodilator-responsive expiratory airflow limitation (if FEV1 \\< 70% of predicted value or \\< 1.5 L, improving \u2265200 mL and 12% in response to 180 \u00b5g of albuterol aerosol). In addition to the above criteria, patients should have well-controlled asthma as evidenced by ACQ score \\< 1.5.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary sleep pathology, other than insomnia as assessed by sleep history and confirmed by polysomnography to exclude significant sleep apnea (RDI \\> 15), periodic leg movements (movement arousal index \\> 15), REM behavior disorder; or circadian sleep-wake disorders\n* History of cognitive or other neurological disorders;\n* History of DSM-IV criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, including mania or alcohol or substance abuse;\n* Depressive symptoms as assessed by the CES-D.
