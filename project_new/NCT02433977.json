Allied with this, the investigators will define whether supplementing with this bioactive mediator modifies the airway microbiome, and reduces airway inflammation.", "detailedDescription": "Obesity is an asthma comorbidity associated with increased severity, poor control, reduced steroid responsiveness and greater exacerbation and healthcare utilization rates. These associations are not explained by having a greater degree of Th-2 inflammation. Rather, the obese asthma phenotype defined in several cluster studies, has paradoxically reduced levels of Th-2 biomarkers, including sputum eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide (NO). The investigators previous research has shown that the inverse relation between increased body mass index (BMI) and reduced exhaled NO, may be explained by a metabolic imbalance characterized by lower L-arginine and greater asymmetric di-methyl arginine (ADMA) levels. Having a low L-arginine/ADMA ratio has been shown to inhibit and uncouple all isoforms of nitric oxidase synthase (NOS), thereby reducing NO bioavailability and promoting oxidative stress through enhanced superoxide production. In obese asthmatics, this imbalance not only correlates with exhaled NO, but also with lower FEV1% and poorer asthma-related quality of life. Yet the effect of obesity in asthma is unlikely to be solely dependent on a single mechanism. Other factors, such as increased Th1 and Th-17-mediated inflammation have been shown to occur in human and animal models. Given all of these potential avenues, it is imperative that an intervention is sufficiently pleiotropic that can, in addition to restoring airway NO levels, also reduce other obesity-related non-Th2 mechanism of inflammation. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with conjugated linolenic acid (CLA) + nitrate and nitrite (together known as NOx), will restore NO airway bioavailability, reduce oxidative stress and improve airway inflammation in obese asthmatics. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose a phase II pilot study in which obese asthmatics with metabolic syndrome, will be treated orally with CLA+NOx for 8 weeks, in an open label study design to assess pre to post-intervention changes in airway and systemic biomarkers, and to determine the effects on lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Participants will undergo a pre and post intervention bronchoscopy. The results obtained from this project will be greatly informative to our understanding of the obese - asthma pathophysiology and for the development of clinical trials to determine the potential benefit of this intervention in improving health outcomes."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Obesity", "conjugated linolenic acid", "nitrate", "nitrite", "nutritional supplements"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 6, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Conjugated Linolenic Acid + NOx", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "This is a single arm study\n\nConjugated Linolenic Acid (CLA)- daily oral dose 3 g/day\n\nSodium Nitrate- Capsules for daily oral administration at the dose of 1 g (2 x 500 mg)\n\nSodium Nitrite- Capsules for daily oral administration at the dose of 20 mg (2 x 10 mg)", "interventionNames": ["Dietary Supplement: Conjugated Linolenic Acid", "Drug: Sodium Nitrite", "Drug: Sodium Nitrate"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT", "name": "Conjugated Linolenic Acid", "description": "CLA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid Subjects will receive capsules for daily oral administration at the dose of 3 g/day", "armGroupLabels": ["Conjugated Linolenic Acid + NOx"], "otherNames": ["conjugated linolenic acid (CLA)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Sodium Nitrite", "description": "Subjects will receive capsules for daily oral administration at the dose of 20 mg (2 x 10 mg)", "armGroupLabels": ["Conjugated Linolenic Acid + NOx"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Sodium Nitrate", "description": "Subjects will receive capsules for daily oral administration at the dose of 1g (2 x 500 mg)", "armGroupLabels": ["Conjugated Linolenic Acid + NOx"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Exhaled NO Before and After Treatment", "description": "Determine how CLA and NOx affect airway NO bioavailability (exhaled NO)", "timeFrame": "Before treatment at baseline and after treatment at 8 weeks"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Biomarkers of Inflammation-bronchial Hyperresponsiveness Using PC20", "description": "To determine whether, compared to baseline, treatment with NOx + CLA can reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
