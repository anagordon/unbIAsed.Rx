The team will come to a patient's home and assess the needs of both the patient and caregiver (if present), and connect the patient with any needed services. These visits can replace or be in addition to seeing another movement disorders doctor.\n\nUsual Care Arm:\n\nThe information collected from the home visit participants will be compared to data collected from participants who elect to complete the usual care arm of the study. These participants and their caregivers (if available) will be invited to complete an online version of the survey.
