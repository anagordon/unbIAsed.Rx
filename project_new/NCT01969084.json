Investigators hypothesize that Linagliptin will reduce the proinflammatory state, improve endothelial function, increase the blood flow at the muscle microcirculation level and improve mitochondrial function. In this study, investigators will perform tests that evaluate the function of small and large blood vessels by employing ultrasound and laser doppler techniques. In addition MRI scans that evaluate the mitochondrial function of the lower extremity muscles at rest and during exercise will also be employed. Forty subjects with Type 2 diabetes will be studied for twelve weeks and half of them will be randomly assigned to receive linagliptin while the other half will receive placebo.
