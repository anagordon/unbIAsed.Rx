The Propeller Health goal is to bring together the best technology and asthma insight in order to provide Dignity Health with an engaging, data-driven chronic care program to improve asthma management and lower healthcare utilization costs, and to respond to prevention-focused reforms to health insurance laws.\n\nThis project has been designed to implement and evaluate a data-driven program to improve asthma management and control and lower direct costs through reductions in healthcare utilization. This program has been developed by Propeller Health and has gone through preliminary testing. Each subject participating in the study will receive an Propeller Health device, which captures the time and location of use of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators over a twelve-month period. This information is processed and delivered at regular intervals to the patient and his or her provider to support improved asthma management.", "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of the adoption of the Propeller Health system into a healthcare organization, and to provide sufficient information to inform decision making for potential future adopters. The researchers believe that the Propeller Health system has the potential to improve asthma control by providing rescue inhaler actuation data and tailored asthma management tips to patients with uncontrolled asthma, and rescue inhaler actuation data to their providers. Improvements in asthma control should be reflected in reductions in healthcare utilization for asthma, and potentially for general healthcare utilization. Reductions in utilization would result in lower healthcare costs. The study has been designed to capture data on individual subject asthma control, and changes in utilization and costs over a one-year introduction period."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["asthma", "healthcare utilization costs"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 495, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention Group", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Intervention group (IG) participants received access to and feedback from the Propeller Health System (formerly Asthmapolis System).", "interventionNames": ["Device: Propeller Health System (formerly Asthmapolis System)"]}, {"label": "Control Group", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Control group (CG) participants were outfitted with sensors from the Propeller Health System, but did not receive feedback."}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Propeller Health System (formerly Asthmapolis System)", "description": "The Propeller (formerly Asthmapolis) system works through the provision of information to patients and their providers.
