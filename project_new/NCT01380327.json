Therefore, a major goal of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) is ultimately to conduct a large multi-center trial of cockroach sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in inner-city asthma. As a step toward achieving this goal, ICAC is conducting a clinical trial comparing two doses of glycerinated German cockroach (Blattella germanica) allergenic extract to placebo, administered under the tongue (sublingual)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma", "Perennial Allergic Rhinitis"], "keywords": ["cockroach", "immunotherapy", "sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)", "inner city asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1", "PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 99, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Cockroach Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) - Low Dose", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Glycerinated German cockroach (Blatella germanica) allergen extract administered sublingually with a maximally tolerated dose of 420 microliters daily", "interventionNames": ["Biological: Cockroach Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) - Low Dose"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Placebo administered sublingually not to exceed the maximally tolerated dose of either 1.) 420 microliters daily (placebo - low dose randomization) or 2.) 840 microliters twice daily (placebo - high dose randomization)", "interventionNames": ["Other: Placebo"]}, {"label": "Cockroach Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) - High Dose", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Glycerinated German cockroach (Blatella germanica) allergen extract administered sublingually with a maximally tolerated dose of 840 microliters taken twice daily", "interventionNames": ["Biological: Cockroach Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) - High Dose"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "Cockroach Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) - Low Dose", "description": "Participants are randomized to receive daily doses of glycerinated German cockroach (Blattella germanica) allergenic extract formulated in 50% glycerin at a concentration of 1:20 weight per volume \\[w/v\\] placed under the tongue (sublingual route) to dissolve.
