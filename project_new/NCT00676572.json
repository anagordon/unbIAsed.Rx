We wish to find out whether this enzyme is more active in cells obtained from patients with severe asthma compared to those with non-severe asthma. We would like to understand how this enzyme can cause the cell to respond less well to the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids. We also wish to find out whether any specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK can improve severe asthma by improving the effects of corticosteroids on these cells.\n\nWe hypothesise that activation of the intracellular MAPK signalling pathway underlies the inflammatory processes of severe asthma, and leads to the diminution of the anti-inflammatory actions of CS through histone modification.", "detailedDescription": "DESIGN Comparative study to analyse differences in the characteristics of lung macrophages and blood monocytes between non-severe and severe asthmatics.\n\nAIMS\n\n1. To determine whether there are differences in terms of cell expression and activation between lung macrophages and blood monocytes from non-severe and severe asthma\n2. To determine the mechanisms of the lung macrophage and blood monocyte relative resistance to the effect of corticosteroids in severe asthma, and particularly focus on the role of p38 MAPK\n3. To determine the differences in airway smooth muscle cells between non-severe and severe asthma\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\n\n1. Clinically the differences in inflammatory and remodelling markers between non-severe and severe asthma\n2. Differences in histone phosphorylation, NF-kB activity and glucocorticoid receptor activation and actions in macrophages and monocytes between non- severe and severe asthma\n3. Differences in behaviour of airway smooth muscle cells cultured from biopsies obtained from non-severe and severe asthma\n\nSevere and non-severe asthmatic subjects will be classified following ATS criteria. They undergo spirometry with reversibility testing, PC20, skin prick tests, exhaled nitric oxide measurements and induced sputum.
