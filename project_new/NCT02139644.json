calculation. Data from these assessments were used to analyze the primary endpoint of baseline adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12 using the trapezoidal rule based on actual time of measurement. It was standardized by dividing it by the number of hours between the start time of dose administration and the end time of the last nonmissing FEV1 measurement.\n\nThe baseline FEV1 was the average of the 2 predose FEV1 measurements (30 and 10 minutes predose). If 1 of these was missing, the nonmissing value was used; if both were missing, baseline was treated as missing.
