Our study population is Caribbean-descent individuals in Region 2, Trinidad and Barbados. The investigators will have five clinical intervention sites situated in New York - 2, Puerto Rico -1, Barbados -1, Trinidad -1 and US Virgin Islands -1. These sites were chosen because of the investigators' strong research network in these locations, and to enable us to address diabetes disparities due to geographic differences. The investigators will first modify an established lifestyle modification workshop series developed by the East Harlem Partnership for Diabetes Prevention (EHPDP) for use in the community, 10to target the population at the involved clinical sites. The investigators plan to adapt the D-CLIP protocol and escalate to Metformin therapy for the highest risk pre-diabetic patients whose hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has not improved or who remain morbidly obese.\n\nThe investigators will leverage our existing robust research infrastructure and network at the five sites through our Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN) and now the Yale Transdisciplinary Collaborative center for Health Disparities focused on Precision Medicine (Yale-TCC). ECHORN is a research collaboration funded by the NIMHD (U2458849938) to address the burden of chronic disease in USVI, PR and the Eastern Caribbean. The Yale-TCC (U54MD010711) leverages the infrastructure and knowledge of the ECHORN, expands to include New York and New Jersey and focuses on diabetes and hypertension. The investigators' network includes community advisory boards as well as policy delegations that are well suited to inform this project and its expansion into routine healthcare practice and policy.\n\nThe control arm of this study was never activated due to COVID-19 restrictions."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Patient Recruitment:\n\nThe investigators are targeting the highest risk pre-diabetic patients for this study.
