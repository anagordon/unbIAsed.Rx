Both formulations will be delivered at the 250/50mcg (micrograms) twice daily (bid) dose strength.\n\nSTUDY RATIONALE The fluticasone propionate/salmeterol capsule-based inhaler has been developed for administration in both asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Therefore, both disease populations are included in this study. The study will assess the performance of the two devices with respect to systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic effects. A replicated cross-over design (four period) was chosen. This design reduces subject numbers by about 50% compared to a standard 2-period cross-over design.\n\nOBJECTIVES Primary Objective\n\n-To compare the performance of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol administered in a capsule-based inhaler with the multi-dose dry powder inhaler by evaluating fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the salmeterol component of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol after administration from a capsule-based inhaler and from the multi-dose dry powder inhaler\n* To compare the safety and tolerability of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol after administration in a capsule-based inhaler with the multi-dose dry powder inhaler.\n\nENDPOINTS Primary Endpoints\n\n* Pharmacokinetic endpoint: AUC\u03c4 for fluticasone propionate (area under the plasma fluticasone propionate concentration-time curve over dosing interval) on the last day of each study treatment period (Day 10).\n* Pharmacodynamic endpoint: Weighted mean serum cortisol over 12h on the last day of each treatment period (Day 10).\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\n* Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUClast, AUC(0-t), Cmax, Cmin, tmax, \u03bbz, and t1/2 for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol) on the last day of each treatment period (Day 10).\n* Pharmacodynamic parameters:\n* Fluticasone propionate: Urine cortisol excretion (0-24h) and serum cortisol Cmin on the last day (Day 10) of each treatment period,\n* Salmeterol: pharmacodynamic parameters for pulse rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), plasma potassium and glucose (weighted mean 0-12h and Cmax/Cmin) on the last day (Day 10) of each treatment period\n* Safety and tolerability: Incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities\n\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a randomised, four-period cross-over, double-blind, double-dummy study. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg bid from a capsule-based inhaler and from a multi-dose dry powder inhaler for 10 days per each treatment period in a randomised order. To maintain the double blind, each patient will receive both active treatment and placebo at the same time from two separate devices. Patients already on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy or combination treatment prior to randomization will stop their existing treatment and switch to treatment provided by the study-provided devices.\n\nThe study has been designed to compare the administration of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from two inhalation devices, a capsule-based inhaler and a multi-dose dry powder inhaler. Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol administered via the multi-dose dry powder inhaler will be the reference product. Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a capsule-based inhaler for administration for the treatment of both asthma and COPD.\n\nTREATMENT ASSIGNMENT Subjects will be assigned to one of two treatment sequences in accordance with the randomisation schedule Sequence ABBA (Periods 1 to 4): A: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a multi-dose dry powder inhaler; B: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a capsule-based inhaler; B: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a capsule-based inhaler; A: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a multi-dose dry powder inhaler Sequence BAAB (Periods 1 to 4): B: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a capsule-based inhaler; A: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a multi-dose dry powder inhaler; A: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a multi-dose dry powder inhaler; B: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol from a capsule-based inhaler."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["safety", "replicated cross-over design", "pharmacodynamics", "Fluticasone propionate/Salmeterol", "capsule-based inhaler", "COPD", "asthma", "multi dose dry powder inhaler", "bioavailability", "pharmacokinetics"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1", "PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 60, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "SERETIDE Rotacaps", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Fluticasone propionate (250 micrograms \\[ug\\])/Salmeterol (50 ug) combination delivered in a capsule-based inhaler", "interventionNames": ["Drug: SERETIDE Rotacaps"]}, {"label": "SERETIDE Diskus", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Fluticasone propionate (250 ug)/Salmeterol (50 ug) combination delivered in a multi-dose dry powder inhaler", "interventionNames": ["Drug: SERETIDE Diskus"]}, {"label": "Placebo Rotacaps", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Placebo delivered in a capsule-based inhaler", "interventionNames": ["Drug: SERETIDE Diskus"]}, {"label": "Placebo Diskus", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Placebo delivered in a multi-dose dry powder inhaler", "interventionNames": ["Drug: SERETIDE Rotacaps"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "SERETIDE Rotacaps", "description": "The study consists of four treatment periods of 10 +/- 1 days each in a cross-over fashion.
