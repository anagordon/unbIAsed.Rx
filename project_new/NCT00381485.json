A subject must have been on a stable asthma regimen (daily dose unchanged) for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

Note: If a subject is to qualify using diurnal variation, the subject should be instructed to perform his/her PEF evaluation after using his/her bronchodilator in the evening.\n* At the Screening Visit, the subject's FEV1 must be \\>=50% predicted when all restricted medications have been withheld for the appropriate intervals.\n* At the Baseline Visit, the subject's FEV1 must be \\>=50% and \\<=85% predicted when all restricted medications have been withheld for the appropriate intervals.\n* The subject (and parent/guardian for a subject under the age of legal consent) must be willing to give written informed consent and be able to adhere to dose and visit schedules.\n* A female subject of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable, adequate form of birth control. This includes:\n\n  * hormonal contraceptive as prescribed by a physician (oral combined, hormonal vaginal ring, hormonal implant or depot-injectable);\n  * medically prescribed intra-uterine device (IUD);\n  * medically prescribed topically-applied transdermal contraceptive patch;\n  * condom in combination with a spermicide (double-barrier method);\n  * monogamous relationship with a male partner who has had a vasectomy.

A female subject of childbearing potential who is not currently sexually active must agree and consent to using a medically acceptable method should she become sexually active during the course of this study.

Visits can be rescheduled 2 weeks after complete resolution of the event to re-assess eligibility.\n* A subject who is a smoker or ex-smoker and has smoked within the previous year or has had a cumulative smoking history \\>10 pack-years.\n* A subject with a clinically significant abnormal vital sign.\n* A subject with evidence (upon visual inspection, laboratory culture is not required) of clinically significant oropharyngeal candidiasis at Baseline (Visit 3) with or without treatment. If there is evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis at Screening or Pre-Baseline Visit, the subject may be treated as appropriate and the Baseline Visit can be scheduled upon resolution. If there is evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis at the Baseline Visit, the subject may be treated as appropriate and the visit can be rescheduled upon resolution.\n* A subject with a history of clinically significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, hematologic, ophthalmologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or other significant medical illness or disorder which, in the judgment of the investigator, could interfere with the study, or require treatment that might interfere with the study. Specific examples include (but are not limited to) insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension being treated with beta blockers, active hepatitis, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, stroke, severe rheumatoid arthritis, chronic open-angle glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or conditions that may interfere with respiratory function such as clinically diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, etc. Other conditions that are well-controlled and stable (eg, hypertension not requiring beta blockers) will not prohibit participation if deemed appropriate per the investigator's judgment.\n* A subject who is known to be allergic to or intolerant of ICS, beta2 agonists, or any of the excipients present in the medications used in this study.\n* A female subject who is breast-feeding, pregnant, or intends to become pregnant while participating in this study.\n* A subject who is a known illicit drug user.\n* A subject who is known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive (HIV testing will not be conducted in this study).\n* A subject who is unable to correctly use an oral MDI inhaler.\n* A subject who has been taking any of the restricted medications prior to Screening without meeting the required washout timeframes.\n* A subject who cannot adhere to the permitted concomitant medications and prohibited medications.\n* A subject participating in this study may not participate in this same study at another investigational site.
