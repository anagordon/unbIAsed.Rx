For each patient and all time points of data collection, a regression analysis was applied to determine the highest predicted percentage change LV dP/dtmax or percentage change Nexfin pressure per configuration. The Kappa statistic was then determined based on a 7x7 contingency table where the rows and columns corresponded to the pacing configurations.
