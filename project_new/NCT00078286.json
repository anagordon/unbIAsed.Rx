Depressive disorders lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and poorer outcomes in ischemic heart disease, a leading cause of chronic heart failure (CHF). Evidence suggests that a relationship exists between depression and CHF; studies that examine the way CHF is affected by depression treatments are needed.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or placebo for 12 weeks. Assessments will be made at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Participants who do not respond to their treatment will have their medication dose adjusted following assessment. Interviews and rating scales will be used to assess depressive symptoms, cognitive status, psychiatric comorbidity, daily and chronic stress, and social support.
