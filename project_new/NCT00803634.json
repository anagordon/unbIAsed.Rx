Eligible patients were randomized to receive clevidipine or standard of care (SOC) intravenous antihypertensive treatment in an open-label manner in a ratio of 1:1. At the time of randomization, a patient-specific, prespecified SBP target range was determined and be recorded, prior to study drug treatment. Information on the dosing regimen, use of additional or alternative agents and transition to oral therapy if needed is detailed in the study 'ARM' and 'INTERVENTION' sections.\n\nA Data Safety Monitoring Board was utilized periodically throughout the study to monitor the safety of patients. Adverse events were assessed for 7 days post-study randomization or hospital discharge, whichever occured first. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed for 30 days following study randomization.
