The primary aim will be to study changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in patients presenting to an urban pediatric emergency department with a moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbation when utilizing these two nebulizers. Secondary aims will include evaluation of hospital admission rates, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), changes in asthma severity scores, vital sign changes, medication side effects, and total quantity of albuterol given in the ED. A distal aim of the study will be to perform a cost analysis; though the investigators will likely need further clinical trials utilizing multiple dose administration in order to accurately analyze cost."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 118, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "T-piece Nebulizer", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Pre-treatment spirometry measurement will be performed, intervention with a one time 5mg nebulized albuterol treatment will be administered with the experimental \"T-piece Nebulizer\" (Hudson RCI\u00ae Micro Mist\u00ae nebulizer Teleflex Medical\u00ae, Research Triangle Park, NJ).
