Recent studies found that 60% of moderate asthmatics and 70% of severe asthmatics report using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to self-treat their asthma symptoms.The exact mechanism of action of these agents is unclear but may involve attenuation of allergic response, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and/or direct effects on airway smooth muscle which are responsible for airway narrowing in asthma.\n\nStudies done in mouse models of asthma and directly on airway smooth muscle cells demonstrate that ginger blocks one of the critical inflammatory pathways in asthma and thus leads to reduced airway inflammation and relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Clinical trials with chronic oral ginger therapy in humans have demonstrated safe consumption of 2 grams per day for 28 days with demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in colon cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that oral ginger at a dose of 2 grams per day will reduce airway inflammation and will reduce serum levels of asthma related inflammatory markers."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Ginger", "Dietary supplement"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["EARLY_PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Double blind placebo controlled", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 54, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Active drug", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects assigned to the intervention will receive 2 grams daily of Ginger Extract for 56 days.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Ginger Extract"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Subjects assigned to the placebo group will receive a matching placebo for 56 days.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Ginger Extract", "description": "2gm Capsule of Ginger extract", "armGroupLabels": ["Active drug"], "otherNames": ["Ginger"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Matching Placebo", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Tolerance to Inhaled Methacholine", "description": "A methacholine challenge test is a medical test used to assist in the diagnosis of asthma.
