This study will compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of mepolizumab administered as a liquid drug product in two different devices with the reconstituted lyophilized drug product in healthy subjects.

Approximately 243 healthy subjects will be randomized so that at least 9 subjects are randomized to each mepolizumab treatment within each weight strata and 3 subjects within each mepolizumab treatment, weight strata and injection site.
