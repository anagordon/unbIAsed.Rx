Patients are then separated into 2 groups: one group is asked to use fluticasone (Flovent), the other to use fluticasone with salmeterol , twice daily over a 16-week period (patients will need to be seen monthly during this time). Neither study personnel nor patients will know which drug is being used.\n\nPatients are also asked to use a peak flow meter and record their daily results on a form, along with the number of puffs they use of their rescue inhaler each day. They also record any changes in asthma medications and information on any asthma episodes.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that there are certain patients with asthma who will do better when a long acting beta agonist is removed from their maintenance asthma medications.", "detailedDescription": "Beta 2 (b2) agonists are the most common type of bronchodilator used to treat asthma. Beta 2 (b2) agonists are agents that bind to b2 receptors and cause muscle relaxation of the airways. There are different variants of the gene (genotypes) that influence how b2 agonists perform among the population.\n\nA recent study demonstrated that patients with mild asthma and the Arg/Arg variant at the 16th amino acid position have improved lung function and asthma control when albuterol (Proventil-HFA), a short acting b2 agonist, is replaced with a different class of bronchodilator. The investigators plan to study asthma patients with distinct genetic makeups of the b2 receptor; specifically Arg/Arg and Gly/Gly.\n\nThroughout the treatment period, patients will be instructed to use ipratropium bromide (Atrovent-HFA), a bronchodilator which works through a different mechanism for rescue therapy; albuterol will be available for use if necessary.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine if the withdrawal of a beta 2 agonist leads to improved asthma control in those asthmatic patients with the Arg/Arg genotype compared with those with the Gly/Gly genotype."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["asthma", "beta agonist", "bronchodilator", "pulmonary", "genotype", "pharmacogenomics", "corticosteroid", "allergy", "immunology"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 90, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Arg/Arg genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Asthma patients with the Arg/Arg genotype who are randomized to continue the combination therapy of a specific long-acting beta 2 agonist (salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) in the form of Advair HFA.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Fluticasone with salmeterol", "Drug: Ipratropium HFA", "Drug: Albuterol HFA"]}, {"label": "Gly/Gly genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Asthma patients with the Gly/Gly genotype who are randomized to continue the combination therapy of a specific long-acting beta 2 agonist (salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) in the form of Advair HFA.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Fluticasone with salmeterol", "Drug: Ipratropium HFA", "Drug: Albuterol HFA"]}, {"label": "Arg/Arg genotype on Fluticasone HFA", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Asthma patients with the Arg/Arg genotype who are randomized to fluticasone (Flovent HFA) alone.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Fluticasone HFA", "Drug: Ipratropium HFA", "Drug: Albuterol HFA"]}, {"label": "Gly/Gly genotype on Fluticasone HFA", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Asthma patients with the Gly/Gly genotype who are randomized to fluticasone (Flovent HFA) alone.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Fluticasone HFA", "Drug: Ipratropium HFA", "Drug: Albuterol HFA"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Fluticasone with salmeterol", "description": "Fluticasone 45mcg, 115mcg, or 230mcg with salmeterol 21mcg, via HFA device, 2 puffs every 12 hrs, over 16 week study period.", "armGroupLabels": ["Arg/Arg genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA", "Gly/Gly genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA"], "otherNames": ["Advair HFA"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Fluticasone HFA", "description": "Fluticasone HFA alone at 44mcg, 110mcg or 220 mcg 2 puffs every 12 hrs, over 16 week study period.", "armGroupLabels": ["Arg/Arg genotype on Fluticasone HFA", "Gly/Gly genotype on Fluticasone HFA"], "otherNames": ["Flovent HFA"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Ipratropium HFA", "description": "Primary as-needed rescue medication in all treatment groups", "armGroupLabels": ["Arg/Arg genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA", "Arg/Arg genotype on Fluticasone HFA", "Gly/Gly genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA", "Gly/Gly genotype on Fluticasone HFA"], "otherNames": ["Atrovent"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Albuterol HFA", "description": "Secondary as-needed rescue medication in all treatment groups", "armGroupLabels": ["Arg/Arg genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA", "Arg/Arg genotype on Fluticasone HFA", "Gly/Gly genotype on Advair (Fluticasone with Salmeterol) HFA", "Gly/Gly genotype on Fluticasone HFA"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Absolute Change in Morning Peak Flow", "description": "Absolute change in morning peak flow at the end of the 16-week study period compared with baseline (last two weeks of run-in).
