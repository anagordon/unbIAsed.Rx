Metolazone is an oral thiazide-type diuretic commonly used for this purpose. Due to its delayed absorption, some clinicians suggest that metolazone be given 30-60 minutes prior to the loop diuretic. However, the efficacy and safety of such a strategy has not been investigated despite its added complexity. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pre-dosing with metolazone confers a difference in efficacy and safety compared to administering it at the same time as furosemide."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Fluid Overload", "Heart Failure Acute"], "keywords": ["diuretic", "metolazone", "furosemide"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Prospective, randomized, open-label, active control pilot study", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 3, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Metolazone Pre-dosing", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Metolazone 5 mg by mouth administered 60 minutes prior to furosemide background therapy (120 - 160 mg intravenous bolus, followed by furosemide 120 - 160 mg intravenous bolus 12 - 24 hours after)", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Metolazone 60 minutes prior to furosemide"]}, {"label": "Metolazone Concurrent Dosing", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Metolazone 5 mg by mouth administered at the same time as furosemide background therapy (120 - 160 mg intravenous bolus, followed by furosemide 120 - 160 mg intravenous bolus 12 - 24 hours after)", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Metolazone concurrently with furosemide"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Metolazone 60 minutes prior to furosemide", "description": "All patients will receive furosemide background therapy (furosemide 120 - 160 mg IV bolus dosed twice within a twenty four hour period.
