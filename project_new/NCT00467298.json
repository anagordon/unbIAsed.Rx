Two hundred (100 in each group) will be recruited from VA Puget Sound Health Care System over four years. Outcomes will be measured at three points: at entry, at the end of the 6 month intervention, and 12 months after entry. Change in functional capacity at the end of the intervention program is the primary outcome.", "detailedDescription": "This study is a randomized, controlled trial of a cardiopulmonary exercise and self-management intervention to improve functional capacity, health related-related quality of life, and to reduce health care costs in medically fragile, elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure (HF). Specific aims include: (1) To determine the benefits of a combined outpatient/home-based exercise, self-management program on function al capability (daily activity, six-minute walk distance, symptoms), (2) to determine the effects of exercise/self-management on quality of life, health status, cardiopulmonary function, and gait and balance, (3) to test the theoretical self-regulation model for mediating effects on major outcome variables, and (4) to compare health care resource utilization and expenditures between the intervention and usual care groups in order to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program. The primary outcome upon which the study is powered is functional capability measured by daily physical activity. Outcomes will be measured at three time points: at entry and following the intervention at 6 and 12 months. Two-hundred (100/group) will be recruited from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System outpatient clinics. The study will be carried out over four years. Inclusion criteria include standard criteria for severe COPD or HF, optimal medical management, willingness to participate in an outpatient exercise/self-management program, working phone, hospitalization for HF, COPD, or related illness in the past two years or at least two outpatient visits for same over the past year. Exclusion criteria include unstable disease or recent surgery, supplemental oxygen requirement at rest more than 4 LPM, already participating in regular exercise three times a week, inability to ambulate, uncontrolled mental illness, alcohol or drug abuse and life expectancy less than one year. The intervention consists of a month long program of two 2-hour visits a week incorporating equal time for endurance and strength training as well as individually-tailored instruction in self-management of their heart/lung disease. Usual care control is an 8-week standard cardiopulmonary exercise program, two days a week for an hour with some self-management content."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)", "Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Exercise", "heart failure", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "patient education", "costs", "quality of life"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "OTHER", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 90, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Self-management", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Novel intensive self-management education and exercise program of four weeks", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Exercise adherence", "Behavioral: Self-management- prevention of illness", "Behavioral: Self-management of illness"]}, {"label": "Usual care", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Usual care- cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation exercise program of 8 weeks duration"}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Exercise adherence", "description": "The exercise program includes endurance and strength training and warm-up and cool-down strategies.
