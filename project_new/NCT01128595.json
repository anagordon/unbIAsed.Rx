Airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrow as a result of a reaction to triggers like chemicals (house-hold cleaning products, pollution) and allergens (house dust mite and cat or dog fur). The airways become blocked, causing shortness of breath and wheezing. The purpose of this study is to find out more information about how effective the study drugs are at protecting the lungs against allergic triggers of asthma. There are three study drugs being investigated in this study: fluticasone furoate on its own, GW642444M on its own and a combination of fluticasone furoate (FF) and GW642444M.\n\nFF is a corticosteroid that is being developed by for the treatment of asthma. A nasal spray formulation of FF has been approved for marketing in the USA, Europe and Japan for the treatment of hayfever (rhinitis) but the dry powder formulation used in this study is not yet approved.\n\nGW642444M is a long-acting beta2-agonist being developed by GSK for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It works by acting on cells in the lungs, causing some of the muscles around the lungs to relax and open up better (bronchodilation), making breathing easier. The combination of FF/GW642444M is being developed as a once-daily treatment for both asthma and COPD.\n\nStudy treatment will be taken for 21 days in each period (4 treatment periods: FF alone, GW642444M alone, FF/GW64244M combination and placebo) and each subject will receive all treatments. On D21 subjects will undergo an allergen challenge, followed by a methacholine challenge on D22. The washout between treatment periods will be 21-35 days."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["allergen challenge", "early asthmatic response", "mild asthma", "late asthmatic response"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 27, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "ICS", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Fluticasone Furoate"]}, {"label": "ICS/LABA", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: FF/GW642444M"]}, {"label": "LABA", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: GW642444M"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF/GW642444M", "armGroupLabels": ["ICS/LABA"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "GW642444M", "armGroupLabels": ["LABA"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Fluticasone Furoate", "armGroupLabels": ["ICS"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Late Asthmatic Response (LAR): Absolute Change From Saline in Minimum FEV1 Between 4-10 Hours (Hrs) Following the 1-hr Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 21 of Each Treatment Period", "description": "Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second.
