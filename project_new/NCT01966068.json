Technically, the portal will be implemented with 2 innovative approaches that facilitate rapid cycle evaluation in multiple Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Although many patient portals are simple vehicles for transferring information about upcoming appointments, test results or laboratory findings, the asthma portal in this project extends this basic functionality to provide asthma education, collect patient-reported outcomes, evaluate medication use and side effects, and track parents' preferences and goals. Because asthma is an AHRQ priority condition which addresses three AHRQ priority criteria (children, low income, and special health care needs), our study will use this population to focus on stage 3 Meaningful Use (MU3) objectives. It is the hope that by conducting this study, translational knowledge will be gained to make recommendations for practice implementation and actionable policy statements."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Pediatrics", "Health Technology", "Meaningful Use Stage-3", "Web Portal"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 294, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "MyAsthma Web Portal", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The portal, MyAsthma, will provide asthma education, collect patient-reported outcomes, evaluate medication use and side effects, and track parents' concerns and goals.
