The purpose of the study is to use daily cardiac filling pressures from the Chronicle device to provide timely medication adjustments (diuretics) to subjects.", "detailedDescription": "Subjects will be asked to transmit to the CareLink Network daily. Data specific to this study (subject's daily estimated Pulmonary Arterial Diastolic (ePAD) pressure values) will be extracted from the CareLink database and transferred to the IPC clinician website.\n\nAs each subject is enrolled, clinicians at each participating site will determine the appropriate target pressure range for each subject based on a review of the subject's pressure data. Each day after enrollment, the subject's current pressure data will be compared to a target pressure range that the clinician sets for that subject.\n\nThe patient instruction set (PtIS) is limited to a daily diuretic prescription and associated supplements, per physician discretion. The PtIS should not include adjustments of non-heart failure medications and should not include heart failure medications that are not indicated for day-to-day adjustments (e.g. ACE-Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), and Beta-Blockers).
