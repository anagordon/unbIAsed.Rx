        Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS)
    </h4>

    <p class="lead">
        The Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) is a network of provincial and 
        territorial surveillance systems supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). 
        To identify people with chronic diseases and conditions, provincial and territorial health 
        insurance registry records are linked using a unique personal identifier to the corresponding 
        physician billing claims, hospital discharge abstract records and prescription drug records. 
        Key information about the CCDSS methods and case definitions can be found here:

        ClinicalTrials.gov is an online database providing clinical research studies 
        from over 200 countries to the public, researchers, and health care professionals. 
        It relies on sponsors and investigators to submit and update study information and 
        complies with laws and regulations requiring the public sharing of clinical trial data,
         including results. ClinicalTrials.gov launched in 2000 and was created as part of the Food 
         and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. This law required the U.S. National 
         Institutes of Health (NIH) to create a database of clinical trials that have an
