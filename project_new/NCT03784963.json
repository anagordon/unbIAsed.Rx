Half of the patients with history of bleeding will receive fish oil while the other half will not. Markers of angiogenesis and inflammation, as well as changes in the microbiome will be assessed in each group.", "detailedDescription": "A potential mechanism of bleeding in patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD) is dysfunctional angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a complicated process controlled by several markers. Previous studies have shown that elevated Angiopoietin-2 and TNF-alpha are associated with bleeding events in CF-LVAD patients.\n\nFish oil has anti-inflammatory and potentially anti-angiogenic properties. A retrospective study of CF-LVAD patients on high-dose fish oil showed a marked decrease in gastrointestinal bleeding rates in these patients. Additionally, these patients had lower levels of circulating Angiopoietin-2. Fish oil is known to have an effect on the microbiome, and the aforementioned effects may be seen in changes of the microbiota."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure", "Gastrointestinal Bleeding"], "keywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Inflammation", "Microbiome"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1", "PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 35, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Primary Prevention Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "In patients with CF-LVAD who have not had a gastrointestinal bleed, patients randomized to intervention will receive 4 grams of Nature Made Ultra Omega-3 Fish Oil once daily for 1 year along with standard of care.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Omega 3 fatty acids"]}, {"label": "Primary Prevention Non-Intervention", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "In patients with CF-LVAD who have not had a gastrointestinal bleed, patients randomized to placebo will receive no fish oil and only standard of care.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Placebo"]}, {"label": "Secondary Prevention Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "In patients with CF-LVAD who have had a gastrointestinal bleed, patients randomized to intervention will receive 4 grams of Nature Made Ultra Omega-3 Fish Oil once daily for 1 year along with standard of care.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Omega 3 fatty acids"]}, {"label": "Secondary Prevention Non-Intervention", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "In patients with CF-LVAD who have had a gastrointestinal bleed, patients randomized to placebo will receive no fish oil and only standard of care.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Omega 3 fatty acids", "description": "Patients will receive 4 grams fish oil once daily", "armGroupLabels": ["Primary Prevention Intervention", "Secondary Prevention Intervention"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Standard of care", "armGroupLabels": ["Primary Prevention Non-Intervention", "Secondary Prevention Non-Intervention"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Markers of Angiogenesis - Angiopoietin 1/2 and VEGF", "description": "Markers of angiogenesis and inflammation will be measured on customized Luminex assay panels.
