Treatment is initiated with 6 doses of the study drug on top of their ICS/LABA controller medication. Prior to the 7th dose of the study drug the LABA is withdrawn. The following 3 doses are given when ICS is tapered down. Dose 7 is given on top of 100% of their ICS, dose 8 is given on top of 50% of the ICS dose, which is then tapered down to 25% the following week and withdrawn completely prior to dose 10 of the study drug. During the last 3 weeks of treatment (ie last 4 doses), the study drug is given as monotherapy. SABA is used as reliever medication during the whole study period. Primary endpoint is Loss of asthma control, defined as any of the following criteria: a) An increase of ACQ-5 to 1.5 or more b) A reduction of 30% or more in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) from baseline on 2 consecutive days c) At least six additional reliever inhalations of SABA in a 24-hour period relative to baseline on 2 consecutive days and d) An exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids\n\nWhen the endpoint is met, patients will resume their regular ICS/LABA controller medication and will be followed for an additional 4 weeks, when they do an Early Discontinuation (ED) Visit and will thereafter leave the study. For patients not loosing their asthma control, the full Observational period is up to week 52, when they will do an End of Treatment Visit (EOT).
