This population is at greatest risk for poor health outcomes. Children with asthma are an important vulnerable subgroup. Asthma, with an estimated prevalence of 6.9%, is the most common chronic condition in children. It is the most frequent reason for pediatric hospitalization and is a condition with documented disparities in care outcomes.\n\nA promising strategy for overcoming the barriers to quality care that these children encounter is the use of care coordinators who educate parents and children, connect the family with needed resources, and coordinate care from different settings. Care coordination has been shown effective in improving receipt of appropriate asthma services and health outcomes for children with asthma. Despite this evidence, there is concern that the effects of care coordination may not be maintained once these services end. This is particularly important given financial pressures to reduce the length and intensity of such services. In order to maintain the gains achieved during care coordination, families need to be able to identify and overcome barriers to care for and by themselves. This can be achieved through the use of Problem Solving Therapy, a documented behavioral method for teaching families the skills they need to resolve daily problems and improve adherence to medical regimens for children with chronic health conditions.\n\nStudy Goals: The overall goal of this project is to improve the quality of care and health outcomes for vulnerable children with asthma. The specific aims of this two-phase project are:\n\n* (Phase I) to adapt, in collaboration with community health workers and parents, existing materials to create two culturally and linguistically appropriate treatment manuals: a Care Coordination Treatment Manual that will standardize the delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate home-based care coordination and asthma-specific education, and a Problem Solving Therapy Treatment Manual tailored to asthma that will include a detailed, step-by-step guide for implementing this approach to reduce barriers to care.\n* (Phase II) to use the manuals developed in Phase I to perform a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two brief interventions involving Care Coordination and tailored Problem Solving Therapy (tPST) in improving and maintaining improvement in health care quality and health-related quality of life for children with asthma.\n\nEvidence for the efficacy of tPST and the availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate treatment manuals should spur diffusion of this innovation to other practitioners and programs seeking evidence-based, optimal clinical management strategies.\n\nMethodology:\n\nPhase I. Existing materials for the Care Coordination and tPST manuals will be edited and/or rewritten to make them specific to asthma. Then both the manuals and the proposed interventions will be assessed for cultural acceptability though two series of parallel focus groups: one for parents of children with asthma, and the other for home visitors already providing care coordination for families of children with asthma. The revised educational materials will then be translated into Spanish.\n\nPhase II. Children ages 2-12 years with persistent asthma and their families (n = 366) will be randomized into two brief interventions:\n\n1. tPST (six sessions) plus Care Coordination (six home visits over 3 months) versus a Wait List control group (usual care) to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness in improving outcomes 3 months after baseline.\n2. tPST versus Care Coordination and Wait List to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness in maintaining outcomes 9 months after baseline."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Child", "Problem-solving", "Quality of Life", "Barriers to Care"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 252, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Problem solving + care coordination", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Problem solving skills training and asthma care coordination", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Problem solving skills training", "Behavioral: Asthma care coordination", "Other: Usual Care"]}, {"label": "Asthma care coordination", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Asthma care coordination", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Asthma care coordination", "Other: Usual Care"]}, {"label": "Wait-list control", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Usual care", "interventionNames": ["Other: Usual Care"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Problem solving skills training", "description": "See description in Results", "armGroupLabels": ["Problem solving + care coordination"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Asthma care coordination", "description": "See description in Results", "armGroupLabels": ["Asthma care coordination", "Problem solving + care coordination"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Usual Care", "description": "Usual clinical care", "armGroupLabels": ["Asthma care coordination", "Problem solving + care coordination", "Wait-list control"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Parent Proxy-Reported Health-related Quality of Life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory)", "description": "The PedsQL\u2122 4.0 Generic Core Scales Total Scale Score (PedsQL\u2122), which has been shown to be internally consistent, valid, and responsive to indicators of clinical change for children with asthma (Chan, Mangione-Smith, Burwinkle, Rosen, \\& Varni, 2005; Seid et al., in press; Varni et al., 2004).

Home visitors referred families, when necessary, to existing health insurance enrollment assistance, smoking cessation, and other community support services.
