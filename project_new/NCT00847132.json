However, the vast majority of cardiac patients with depression go unrecognized and untreated, despite the existence of treatments that clearly improve depressive symptoms and may favorably impact survival. Our research group and others have found that depression recognition and treatment appears particularly limited among patients with acute cardiac illness, though this population may be the most vulnerable to the deleterious effects of depression. We propose a project, building on successful collaborative care depression management programs in outpatient settings, to address this important issue.\n\nThe specific hypotheses behind the proposed research are that a collaborative care depression management program can be successfully adapted to inpatient cardiac units, and that such a program will lead to greater rates of adequate depression treatment and improvements in secondary outcomes.\n\nThe following specific aims capture the stepwise goals of this program:\n\n1. To determine whether a collaborative care depression management program ('Enhanced Care') leads to significantly increased rates of adequate depression treatment compared to usual care (screening and feedback) (Primary Aim).\n2. To assess whether this Enhanced Care program has a lasting impact on adequate depression treatment, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and adherence to medical recommendations at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months, compared to usual care."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Coronary Artery Disease", "Congestive Heart Failure", "Arrhythmia", "Depression"], "keywords": ["Collaborative Care"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 175, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Collaborative Care", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Collaborative Care Treatment: A study care manager provides depression education, consults with study psychiatrist to develop individualized treatment recommendations, and collaborates with patient and medical team to implement those recommendations", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Collaborative Care Treatment"]}, {"label": "Usual Care", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Usual Care Treatment: Primary medical providers are informed that the patient has depression and that treatment is recommended.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Usual Care Treatment"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Collaborative Care Treatment", "description": "Depression education, treatment recommendations, coordination of care", "armGroupLabels": ["Collaborative Care"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Usual Care Treatment", "description": "Treatment as usual, providers are notified of diagnoses", "armGroupLabels": ["Usual Care"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Rates of Adequate Depression Treatment at Discharge", "description": "Adequate treatment was defined a priori as either: (1) discharge prescription of an antidepressant at a clinically effective dose based on manufacturers' package labeling and treatment guidelines for the treatment of depression or (2) referral to a mental health treatment provider for psychotherapy (unless pre-planned as less than six sessions).\n\nTimeframe of \"5 days after enrollment\" was determined by calculating the median length of hospitalization for all subjects.", "timeFrame": "5 days after enrollment"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Depression Symptoms From Baseline to 6 Months", "description": "Depression symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).
