The rationale for this study design is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Reveal LINQ\u2122 to monitoring walking patterns.\n\nHF patients (the target population for the study in discussion) would make it possible to test the sensitivity of the accelerometer embedded in the LINQ device in a small cohort of subjects with reduced mobility and for which frailty is more prevalent than the general population, as well as recognized as an important prognostic indicator.\n\nNo risk to the subjects is expected with this study."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "OTHER", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 15, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "single arm", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Single arm, all the patients enrolled will perform the same walking exercises.\n\nOn arrival to the rehabilitation center subjects will have the Reveal LINQ, the 3D-accelerometers (one on the chest by medical-grade adhesives and a second at the level of the waist over the top of a medical grade adhesive) and the Holter attached externally.
