The cat allergen levels in the model are similar to those found in homes with cats and are capable of inducing lower- and upper-airway responses that have been used to assess the efficacy of several asthma and allergy therapies.\n\nCat allergen exposure was performed in a room furnished with upholstered furniture, a blanket, and a cat litter box. The door was kept closed at all times, except when personnel or study patients were entering or leaving the room. The ventilation system was operating at all times except during cat allergen challenges. Two neutered adult cats were kept in the room at all times and were free to move about except during challenges, at which time they are placed in wire cages. Immediately before a challenge, the blanket was shaken vigorously to distribute cat allergen throughout the room."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Xolair", "Allergic asthma", "Cat allergy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 69, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Omalizumab", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients received omalizumab via subcutaneous injection either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.
