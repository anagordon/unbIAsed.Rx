It causes frequent wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough. Asthma attacks, or exacerbations, are problems for children with asthma.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if treatment with a medication called mepolizumab (Nucala\u00ae), given along with standard asthma care, makes children less likely to have asthma attacks. Mepolizumab is a new drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children with asthma who are aged 12 years and older. Mepolizumab is given by injection. It is being studied by other researchers in children aged 6-11 years.\n\nAll participants will be prescribed standard asthma medications by a clinician who is trained in asthma care. Medications will include controller medications, a rescue medication, and a medication for severe asthma attacks (prednisone). The amount of medication that participants receive may be increased or decreased during the study based on their symptoms and breathing test results. Study clinicians will treat all participants according to the same guidelines. These treatment guidelines are based on recommendations from a group of national experts in asthma. This study has been designed this way so that all participants will have safe and effective standard asthma care.\n\nIn order to enroll in this study, participants must be willing to have their asthma managed by the study clinician during the entire study period. Participants must also be willing to bring study medications to all study visits.\n\nThis study will include up to 20 study visits. Participant involvement in the study will endure for approximately 1 year.\n\nDuring the treatment period, participants will be placed in one of two treatment groups:\n\n* Mepolizumab injection and guidelines-based asthma care or\n* Placebo injection and guidelines-based asthma care.\n\nParticipants will not be able to choose which group they are assigned. This assignment is random and by chance, much like flipping a coin. Participants will not know if they are receiving mepolizumab or placebo. Investigators will compare the study results between the participants of each group."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["urban setting", "children and adolescents", "double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized trial", "asthma exacerbations (attacks)", "mepolizumab adjunctive therapy", "asthma exacerbations prevention", "difficult-to-control exacerbation-prone asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 335, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Mepolizumab", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Intervention: Mepolizumab plus guidelines-based standard of care asthma treatment.", "interventionNames": ["Biological: Mepolizumab"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Intervention: Placebo for mepolizumab plus guidelines-based standard of care asthma treatment.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "Mepolizumab", "description": "Mepolizumab administered every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection at a dose of:\n\n* 100 mg for participants \u226512 years of age and\n* 40 mg for participants ages 6 to 11 years and weighing \u226540 kg.\n\nNote: Participants 6 to 11 years of age and weighing \u226540 kg who were enrolled in the study under previous versions of the protocol and were initially assigned a 100 mg dose will have their dose reduced to 40 mg.\n\nParticipants 11 years of age will increase to the 100 mg dose if they become age 12 years during the study.", "armGroupLabels": ["Mepolizumab"], "otherNames": ["Nucala\u00ae", "anti-Interleukin 5 (IL5) antagonist monoclonal antibody"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Placebo administered every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection at a dose of:\n\n* 100 mg for participants \u226512 years of age and\n* 40 mg for participants ages 6 to 11 years and weighing \u226540 kg.\n\nNote: Participants 6 to 11 years of age and weighing \u226540 kg who were enrolled in the study under previous versions of the protocol and were initially assigned a 100 mg dose will have their dose reduced to 40 mg.\n\nParticipants 11 years of age will increase to the 100 mg dose if they become age 12 years during the study.", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"], "otherNames": ["Placebo for Mepolizumab"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Asthma Exacerbations During the Treatment Period", "description": "Exacerbations were defined as a prescription of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a clinician, initiation of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a participant, or as a hospitalization for asthma.
