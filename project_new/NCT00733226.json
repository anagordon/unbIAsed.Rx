OM-85 BV is an bacteria lysate which has been proven to prevent respiratory infections about 40 percent in children.\n\nObjective: To determine if using OM-85 BV diminish the number and duration of the respiratory infections and respiratory infection related wheezing attacks,beta-2 agonist and steroid use, and number and duration of hospitalizations in children with recurrent wheezing and asthma. And also to determine if OM-85 BV has any effect on serum cytokine levels after 6 months.\n\nStudy Design/Setting/Participants: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of OM-85 BV versus placebo for children 6 months to 6 years of age who have respiratory tract infection related recurrent wheezing attacks.\n\nIntervention: Participants will receive either active Broncho-Vaxom or placebo for 3 months.\n\nStudy Measures: They follow up for 1 year for number and duration of wheezing attacks, number, type and duration of respiratory infections, number and duration of beta-2 agonist use, number and duration of steroid use and number and duration of hospitalizations. Serum cytokine levels will measure to determine if Broncho-Vaxom has any effect on serum cytokine levels (at the beginning of the trial and sixth months of the trial)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["wheezing", "asthma", "childhood", "OM-85 BV", "Broncho-Vaxom"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 80, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "1 Broncho-Vaxom", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "The children received one capsule per oral, OM-85 BV (3.5 mg) per day for the first 10 consecutive days of each month for 3 consecutive months.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: OM-85 BV (Broncho-Vaxom)"]}, {"label": "2 (Placebo OM-85 BV)", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "The children received one capsule per oral, placebo per day for the first 10 consecutive days of each month for 3 consecutive months.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: OM-85 BV (placebo)"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "OM-85 BV (Broncho-Vaxom)", "description": "3.5 mg capsule, 1 capsule per day for first 10 day of the month, for 3 months", "armGroupLabels": ["1 Broncho-Vaxom"], "otherNames": ["Bronchovaxom 3.5 mg capsule"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "OM-85 BV (placebo)", "description": "3.5 mg oral placebo capsule, 1 placebo capsule per day for first 10 days of the months for 3 months", "armGroupLabels": ["2 (Placebo OM-85 BV)"], "otherNames": ["Bronchovaxom 3.5 mg placebo capsule"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Mean Rate of Wheezing Attacks", "description": "Acute wheezing attack was defined as episode of progressive increase in shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, retraction of the chest and chest tightness, or combination of these symptoms.
