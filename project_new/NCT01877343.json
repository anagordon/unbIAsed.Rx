These results will be compared to cardiac functional classifications defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria for adults and New York Pediatric Heart Failure (NYPHF) index for our pediatric age patients. The primary aim of this initiative is to assess the discriminatory value of a cardiac functional health classification based upon the degree of dependency of cardiac function on changes in cardiac preload and afterload circulatory volume.", "detailedDescription": "Participants will be asked to review the informed consent and consent to the study prior to any study procedures. The study will consist of a single visit to the Medical Plaza at the University of Florida.

Also, a pulse oximeter will be placed on the forehead to measure pulse rate and strength. The study will take approximately 25 minutes.
