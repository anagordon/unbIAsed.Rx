The study aims: 1\\] Pilot test multi-component balance activities and RT intervention on primary outcomes. 2\\] Explore perceptions related to outcomes and the intervention through focus groups. 3\\] Generate pilot data on adherence. 4\\] Generate pilot data on feasibility of conducting the BASIC Training intervention.\n\nBackground/Significance: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths in this age group. Fall risks are even greater for those with HF due to decreased exercise capacity, loss of skeletal muscle and medication side effects. Though RT is effective for improving skeletal muscle, it has only a modest effect on improving balance, which is comprised of peripheral sensory input central integration, and motor output. A multi-component intervention focusing on balance retraining and strengthening the muscles supporting static/dynamic balance and functional mobility is necessary.\n\nMethods: Design - Randomized, two-group with wait list control, repeated measures experimental design. Sample/ Setting - 40-50 participants recruited from a medical center heart failure clinic; supervised group sessions conducted in the center's health and wellness center. Procedures - Participants will be randomized to the intervention group or the wait list control group. Focus groups pre/post intervention. The intervention will be administered in 1x per week supervised group sessions and 2x a week home sessions. Instruments - 30 Second Sit-to-Stand, Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance, Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Timed Up and Go, Dynamic Gait Index.\n\nAnalysis Plan: Aim 1- independent t-test to compare change scores from baseline to the end of the first 12 week period for the intervention group with the wait list control group. A second analysis will combine data from the delayed intervention period for the wait list control group with that from the first 12 week period for the intervention group to test change. Supplemental analysis, involving only data from intervention group, will test whether change is sustained at 24 weeks. Aim 2 - thematic analysis conducted with focus group data. Aim 3 - adherence assessed by group session attendance and home activities completed. Aim 4 - assess and report logistics of conducting the study.\n\nNursing Relevance/Implications: This pilot study will initiate the process of developing a targeted intervention to induce changes in elderly HF patients to prevent future falls; thus reducing costs, physical and emotional burdens related to falls; and effect a major difference in the quality of life for this population."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 33, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention Group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Those allocated to the intervention group will participate in a supervised group session exercise one time per week and be asked to exercise two more times per week at home.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Balance Intervention"]}, {"label": "Wait List Control Group", "type": "OTHER", "description": "The wait list control group will not participate in the intervention and will be asked to continue their usual activity level during the first 12 weeks and will receive the multi-component balance intervention during weeks 12-24.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Balance Intervention"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Balance Intervention", "description": "The multi-component balance intervention will be 1x per week in supervised group sessions and 2x a week sessions at home.
