They are randomly assigned at the ratio 1:1 to one of the following treatment groups for 7 days: FP Nebules 2\u00d70.5mg/2ml twice daily/Placebo tablets once daily; Or, Oral prednisone tablets once daily (2mg/kg.day, up to 40mg/day for 4 days, then 1mg/kg.day or half of the original dose, up to 20mg/day for 3 days) / Placebo Nebules 2\u00d72ml 0.9% saline twice daily. While all subjects are given Salbutamol Nebules / MDI for relief of symptoms. After randomization (visit 1), the following visits are on Day5 (visit 2) and Day8 (visit 3), and a follow-up phone call (visit4) will happen two weeks post treatment on Day 21 for collection of adverse events.\n\nThe primary endpoint is mean morning PEF on diary card over the treatment assessment period. The secondary endpoints include subject derived data (symptom scores ), evening PEF on diary card, use of rescue medications, clinic assessments of pulmonary function ( FEV1, and FVC) , clinical scoring index , patient/parent and investigator global evaluation, and use of rescue medications during the trial. Safety endpoints include AEs, vital signs, and oropharyngeal examinations, and laboratory tests (haematology, urinalysis, chemistry).
