The run-in period will commence the day following the completion of all screening procedures and will continue through to and include the day prior to the first treatment visit (TV1) such that a minimum of 7 full days of diary data will be collected prior to TV1. The purpose of the run-in period is to assess compliance with a BID dosing regimen and with the completion of the diary entries over a minimum period of 7 days. Patients who demonstrate adequate inhaler technique and who are at least 90% compliant with dosing and completion of the diary on the last 7 consecutive days of run-in will qualify for enrollment into the open-label study. The study treatment period will comprise 6 treatment visits (TV1-TV6) for all enrolled patients except those in the 5-week treatment cohort who will have only 5 treatment visits (TV1-TV5). Patients may continue taking their current asthma or COPD medications throughout the Treatment Period. The patient will return to the clinic on Days 8 (\u00b11), 15 (\u00b11), 22 (\u00b11), and 36 (\u00b11), and then on Day 50 (-2) after approximately all 200 doses have been delivered, or until early withdrawal. The patient will be deemed to have completed the study if at least 90% of the recommended doses contained in Albuterol Spiromax with dose-counter were used. A representative sample (approximately 15%) of patients will participate in the trial for approximately 5 weeks with Day 36 (\u00b11) being the final study visit."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma", "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)"], "keywords": ["asthma", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "COPD", "Albuterol Spiromax\u00ae"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 317, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Albuterol Spiromax\u00ae", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The approximate 50-day treatment period consisted of 180 mcg (90 mcg/dose cycle, 2 dose cycles) twice daily study medication administration with Albuterol Spiromax with dose-counter.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Albuterol Spiromax\u00ae"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Albuterol Spiromax\u00ae", "description": "Albuterol Spiromax delivers 90 mcg of albuterol base from the mouthpiece per triggered dose.
