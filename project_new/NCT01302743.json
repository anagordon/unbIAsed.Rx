Subjects will be randomized into one of three groups, group 1 will receive oral extended-release Metformin 1000mg, group 2 will receive Cinnamon Bark 1000mg, group 3 will receive cinnulin PF 500mg. Subjects will be instructed to take their study pills once a day for 90 days.After 90 days of treatment, each subject will again have hemoglobin A1C, lipid panel, height, weight, blood pressure and waist circumference measured. Analysis described above using intention-to-treat principles for any missing data will be used (we will use the carry-forward method to impute missing data).
