This study is designed to investigate the effects of therapy with atorvastatin in subjects with diastolic heart failure to improve abnormalities of vascular and myocardial structure and function, with particular emphasis on arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.", "detailedDescription": "Forty subjects will be given either drug (atorvastatin 40 mg) or placebo in a randomized fashion once daily for six months. Using echocardiography, tonometry, and flow mediated dilation of conduit arteries and arterioles, baseline cardiovascular anatomy and physiology will be defined. Subjects that enroll in the study will be required to come in for 5 study visits. The initial visit is a screening visit; subject consent is obtained and an echocardiogram is performed as well as blood tests. At the randomization visit (4-14 days following screening), the subject will be provided with drug or placebo in a blinded fashion.Also at this visit, subjects will be asked to do a 6 minute walk, QOL questionnaire, and vascular function testing. There will be follow-up study visits at 1 and 3 months following randomization. At each follow-up visit a medical history, pill count and brief physical examination will be performed, a repeat QOL questionnaire administered, and blood tests to assess safety of the statin therapy. At 6 months, the final study visit will occur. At this visit a full history and detailed physical examination will be performed. Repeat echocardiogram, 6 minute walk test, QOL questionnaire, and vascular function examinations will be performed."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diastolic Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure, Congestive"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Atorvastatin", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Heart failure patients assigned to atorvastatin", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Atorvastatin"]}, {"label": "2", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Atorvastatin", "Other: placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Atorvastatin", "description": "Atorvastatin - 40 mg orally daily for 6 months", "armGroupLabels": ["2", "Atorvastatin"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "placebo", "description": "placebo", "armGroupLabels": ["2"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (CFPWV) in the Statin Treated vs. Control Group", "timeFrame": "6 months after initiation of intervention"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Composite Cardiovascular Endpoint Incorporating Quality of Life (QOL) Assessment + Hospitalizations for Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality", "timeFrame": "6 months after initiation of intervention"}, {"measure": "Changes in Submaximal Exercise Capacity Measured by 6-minute Walk Test", "timeFrame": "6 months after initiation of intervention"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Signed informed consent,\n* Age \\> 18,\n* Ejection fraction \u2265 50%,\n* hospitalization for heart failure in the last 6 months and\n* current NYHA Class II-IV symptoms, OR\n* current NYHA Class III-IV symptoms and one of the following:\n\n  1.
