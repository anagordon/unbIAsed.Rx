Dementia is a contributing cause for 1 in 3 deaths, and is the only major cause of death with no effective prevention or treatment. Dementia-specific palliative care is needed to address the unique symptoms and treatment decisions relevant to this disease.\n\nInvestigators therefore propose to develop and pilot test a model of palliative care consultation for advanced dementia patients, triggered by hospitalization for a serious acute illness. After systematic refinement of operational protocols and tools with stakeholders, they will enroll persons with advanced dementia plus an acute illness associated with high risk of death in the coming year. Patients will be enrolled with their family decision-makers (N=60 dyads) in a randomized feasibility trial. Intervention dyads will receive specialty palliative care consultation during hospital admission, plus post-discharge collaborative care by their outpatient primary care provider and a palliative care nurse practitioner. Control dyads will receive usual care.\n\nThe research objective is to generate preliminary data for a large multi-site randomized controlled trial of a model of palliative care consultation for advanced dementia.\n\nSpecific aims are:\n\nAim 1: To develop a best-practice model of palliative care consultation for advanced dementia triggered by hospital admission for serious acute illness.\n\nAim 2: To conduct a pilot randomized trial of triggered palliative care consultation for advanced dementia (versus usual care) to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a larger randomized trial."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 62, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Specialty Palliative Care", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Specialty inter-disciplinary Palliative Care consultation during hospitalization with post-discharge collaborative care by a Palliative Care Nurse Practitioner and outpatient primary care physician.
