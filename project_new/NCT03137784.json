During a screening epoch patient eligibility will be assessed. The screening epoch will be followed by a 21-day Run-in epoch during which patients will continue their inhaled corticosteroids use but be withdrawn from LABA-treatment and switched to short-acting bronchodilator-rescue medication. After the Run-in period patients will be randomized to one of the 6 treatment sequences and enter the first 7-day study treatment period. Treatment period one is followed by a 10 to 14 days washout period after which patients begin the second 7-day treatment period which is then followed by a second 10 to 14 days washout period followed by the third 7-day treatment period. At the end of each treatment period spirometry will be performed to assess the primary endpoint in terms of trough FEV1. The study population will consist of approximately 144 patients with asthma who have been treated in a stable regimen of ICS/LABA for at least 4 weeks prior to screening."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["asthma,", "NVA237,", "glycopyrronium bromide", "allergic asthma,", "allergy triggered asthma,", "reactive asthma,", "asthma attack,", "difficulty breathing"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2", "PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 148, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "1(NVA237 50 ug/NVA237 25 ug/placebo)", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Treatment sequence: NVA 237 50 ug, 25 ug and placebo", "interventionNames": ["Drug: NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)", "Drug: Placebo"]}, {"label": "2(NVA237 50 ug/placebo/NVA237 25 ug)", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Treatment sequence: NVA 237 50 ug, placebo and 25 ug", "interventionNames": ["Drug: NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)", "Drug: Placebo"]}, {"label": "3 (NVA237 25 ug/NVA237 50 ug/placebo)", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Treatment sequence: NVA237 25 ug, 50 ug and placebo", "interventionNames": ["Drug: NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)", "Drug: Placebo"]}, {"label": "4 (NVA237 25 ug/placebo/NVA237 50 ug)", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Treatment sequence: NVA 237 25 ug, placebo and 50 ug", "interventionNames": ["Drug: NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)", "Drug: Placebo"]}, {"label": "5 (placebo/NVA237 50 ug/ NVA237 25 ug)", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Treatment sequence: Placebo, NVA237 50 ug and 25 ug", "interventionNames": ["Drug: NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)", "Drug: Placebo"]}, {"label": "6 (placebo/ NVA237 25 ug/NVA237 50 ug)", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Treatment sequence: placebo, NVA237 25 ug and 50 ug", "interventionNames": ["Drug: NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)", "Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide)", "description": "In each treatment arm, patient will receive NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide) 25 ug and 50 ug dose", "armGroupLabels": ["1(NVA237 50 ug/NVA237 25 ug/placebo)", "2(NVA237 50 ug/placebo/NVA237 25 ug)", "3 (NVA237 25 ug/NVA237 50 ug/placebo)", "4 (NVA237 25 ug/placebo/NVA237 50 ug)", "5 (placebo/NVA237 50 ug/ NVA237 25 ug)", "6 (placebo/ NVA237 25 ug/NVA237 50 ug)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "In each treatment arm, patient will receive placebo", "armGroupLabels": ["1(NVA237 50 ug/NVA237 25 ug/placebo)", "2(NVA237 50 ug/placebo/NVA237 25 ug)", "3 (NVA237 25 ug/NVA237 50 ug/placebo)", "4 (NVA237 25 ug/placebo/NVA237 50 ug)", "5 (placebo/NVA237 50 ug/ NVA237 25 ug)", "6 (placebo/ NVA237 25 ug/NVA237 50 ug)"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Trough FEV1 After One Week of Treatment, Point Estimate", "description": "To evaluate the bronchodilator effects of NVA237 (25 ug and 50 ug) compared to placebo in terms of trough FEV1 (mean of 23h 15 min and 23 h 45 min post -dose) following 1 week of treatment in the respective treatment period.
