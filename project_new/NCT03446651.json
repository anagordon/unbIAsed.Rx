While sodium homeostasis has been the focus of substantial investigation, very little research has been devoted to understanding chloride homeostasis. Thus, this proposal is designed to obtain the full spectrum of information pertaining to chloride, such as novel areas with great interest by the scientific community (i.e. modulation of the WNK-kinase system and the use of exosomes), to more practical/basic questions (i.e. what happens to sodium chloride balance when a patient is challenged with chloride). The proposed outpatient study has been designed to serve as a real world efficacy study. With extensive biobanking and analysis of samples in the proposed setting, there is the potential to be able to deliver a great wealth of information on the biology and therapeutic potential of manipulating chloride homeostasis in heart failure.\n\nResearch confirms that many heart failure therapies demonstrate measurable benefit in highly controlled environments, but lack effectiveness when studied in decompensated patients receiving standard decongestive therapies. As such, this study seeks to understand the effects of chloride supplementation on volume-overloaded patients concomitantly treated with IV diuretics."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Sodium Homeostasis"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["EARLY_PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 50, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Lysine Chloride", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will be randomized to 7 days of therapy with either 115 mmol/day of lysine chloride or placebo.
