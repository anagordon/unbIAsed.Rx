Overweight participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will be recruited through soccer interest groups, local leagues and Hispanic health organizations. After a baseline assessment visit, participants will attend soccer practice twice a week for 12 weeks while completing the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) core curriculum online modules with facilitated discussion by trained coaches during each soccer practice. Participants will then be invited to join an established small-sided soccer league in their community (for 12 weeks) offering one game per week and will also complete the NDPP maintenance modules and physical activity and diet self-tracking via mobile health technologies. After the core (first 12 weeks) and maintenance intervention periods (second 12 weeks) baseline measurements will be repeated. Data on the feasibility of this DPP soccer-based adaptation will inform future randomized, controlled trials testing the effectiveness of this translation model to reduce T2DM risk while extrapolating to other sports-based adaptation and age, gender and racial sub-populations.", "detailedDescription": "The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has been successful in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through moderate weight loss and increased physical activity, and evidence from the original DPP suggests that adoption of increased physical activity (PA) habits are maintained up to 10 years among intervention participants when compared to control. Hispanic males are difficult to engage in traditional lifestyle or non-communicable chronic disease (NCDs) prevention interventions, yet, they have high rates of obesity and are at high risk for NCDs, particularly T2DM. Small-sided recreational soccer (RS) 6-12 month interventions have shown to be effective to achieve 5% weight loss and reduce cardio-metabolic risk, stemming from its varied movement patterns and highly functional training. Although proven cost-effectiveness and currently expanding in Europe, RS cardio-metabolic preventive interventions have not been tested in U.S. populations.\n\nTo fill this gap in health promotion, the goal for this proposal is to utilize the local Hispanic community's interest in soccer as a vehicle to deliver an adapted DPP among male, overweight, Latino adults at high T2DM risk. The researchers will test the following central hypothesis: A soccer-based adaptation to the DPP, can be feasibly implemented in a middle-age Latino men population at high risk for T2DM. In lieu of the traditional walking or exercise program, participants will be enrolled in 12 weeks of soccer conditioning followed by 12 weeks of small-sided soccer league play. National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) online core and maintenance modules will also be facilitated by trained coaches during soccer practice for the first 12 weeks and through monthly in-person meetings the last 12 weeks. Physical activity volume, sleep and sedentary time will be tracked objectively with wearable devices linked to an innovative research smartphone app that provides data to the researchers and tailored in-app notifications and surveys to the participant. Additionally, the study will assess implementation feasibility and explore preliminary signals for improvements in objectively-measured PA, dietary behaviors, physical fitness and body composition and quality of life outcomes with the soccer-based DPP adaptation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes"], "keywords": ["Behavioral intervention"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "This is a longitudinal pre-post pilot intervention study evaluating feasibility of implementation of a soccer-based Diabetes Prevention Program and preliminary changes in physical activity and diet-related measures.", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 41, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Soccer-based adaptation to the DPP", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Hispanic overweight male participants taking part in a 24 week soccer program as part of diabetes prevention.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Soccer-based adaptation to the DPP"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Soccer-based adaptation to the DPP", "description": "Participants will complete online education modules during an initial 12 week conditioning phase where they will participate in soccer drills and other fitness routines (two 1-hour sessions per week).
