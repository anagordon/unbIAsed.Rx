This would potentially alone or in addition to other clinical or biofluid markers indicate if and how asthma endotypes are linked to phenotype such as eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. Further exploratory markers will be analysed for better understanding of physiological levels of proteins and markers playing a role in regard to disease characterization in asthma. As a basis for further development of a biomarker for asthma, The sponsor plans to conduct this exploratory biomarker trial to determine levels and reference ranges of biomarkers potentially associated with asthma phenotypes. The trial aims at generating a panel of serum biomarkers that can be evaluated in subsequent interventional studies. The longitudinal design will be used to ascertain stability and test-retest reliability.", "detailedDescription": "Purpose:"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "COHORT", "timePerspective": "CROSS_SECTIONAL"}, "bioSpec": {"retention": "SAMPLES_WITH_DNA", "description": "Blood and sputum"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 69, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Healthy subjects", "interventionNames": ["Procedure: Biofluid sampling"]}, {"label": "Mild asthma"}, {"label": "Moderate asthma"}, {"label": "Severe asthma"}], "interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "Biofluid sampling", "armGroupLabels": ["Healthy subjects"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Level of Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in Blood at Baseline (Visit 1)", "description": "Level of Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) \\[picograms per milliliter (pg/mL)\\] in blood at baseline (Visit 1) is presented.", "timeFrame": "Baseline (Visit 1)"}, {"measure": "Level of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Blood at Baseline (Visit 1)", "description": "Level of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (pg/mL) in blood at baseline (Visit 1) is presented.", "timeFrame": "Baseline (Visit 1)"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Level of Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in Blood at Follow-up Visit 28 Days After Baseline (Visit 2)", "description": "Level of Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (pg/mL) in blood at follow-up visit 28 days after baseline (Visit 2) is presented.", "timeFrame": "follow-up visit 28 days after baseline (Visit 2)"}, {"measure": "Level of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Blood at Follow-up Visit 28 Days After Baseline (Visit 2)", "description": "Level of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (pg/mL) in blood at follow-up visit 28 days after baseline (Visit 2) is presented.", "timeFrame": "follow-up visit 28 days after baseline (Visit 2)"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\nBody mass index (BMI) \\>=18 and \\<= 40 Non-smokers or ex-smokers with a cigarette smoking history of \\<= 10 pack years and smoking cessation for at least one year prior to enrolment Able to perform all trial related procedures including acceptable spirometry and production of induced sputum samples\n\nAdditional inclusion criteria for subject with asthma:\n\nA minimum of one year history of asthma (physician diagnosed).
