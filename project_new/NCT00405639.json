The participant will need to give themselves a shot in their stomach (similar to diabetics giving themselves insulin) twice a day for twelve weeks. The study requires a screening visit to determine eligibility and discuss the study. At this visit a blood draw for heart and liver function and a six minute walk will be done. There will also be two other outpatient visits and two inpatient stays, for 48 hours, in the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at St. Marys Hospital. During the two in-patient stays in the GCRC, blood and urine samples will be done to get heart and kidney function as well as a research echo. After enrollment, the study lasts for twelve weeks.
