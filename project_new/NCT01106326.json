We hypothesize that this community-based pilot intervention will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school personnel, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). We anticipate that enhancing preventive healthcare for urban teens with asthma through partnerships with schools will yield improved health, prevention of suffering, decreased absenteeism from school, and reduced healthcare costs. This new method of preventive care delivery could be sustained within the school nursing system, and could be implemented in schools nationwide. Further, it could be applied to other chronic illnesses affecting disadvantaged populations."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 30, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Teens participating in this study will have:\n\n1. directly observed administration of their daily preventive asthma medication at school, by the school nurse, for the first 6-8 weeks of the study\n2. three counseling sessions with a study nurse trained in principles of motivational interviewing (MI), that are designed to enhance the teen's motivation to change health behaviors, with a focus on adherence to evidence-based preventive care guidelines (e.g.; preventive medications).", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Intervention"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Intervention", "description": "Teens participating in this study will have:\n\n1. directly observed administration of their daily preventive asthma medication at school, by the school nurse, for the first 6-8 weeks of the study\n2. three counseling sessions with a study nurse trained in principles of motivational interviewing (MI), that are designed to enhance the teen's motivation to change health behaviors, with a focus on adherence to evidence-based preventive care guidelines (e.g.; preventive medications).", "armGroupLabels": ["Intervention"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Symptom-free Days Over Two Weeks", "description": "We will measure number of symptom-free days at 2-months (at the end of the directly observed therapy phase) and 4-months (after their transition to independence with preventive medications).
