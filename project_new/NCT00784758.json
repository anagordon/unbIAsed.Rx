This will be done by comparing the effects of Fenzian\u2122 treatment to the effects of a sham treatment, which looks the same as the Fenzian\u2122 device but doesn't do anything.\n\nThe Fenzian\u2122 device is an electrical instrument that the investigators hope will help reduce airway inflammation associated with asthma symptoms by stimulating the nerves with very low electrical currents.
