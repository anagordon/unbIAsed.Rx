To determine the feasibility of implementing the intervention using a peer-assisted asthma day camp for adolescents with asthma.\n2. To determine patterns of change in knowledge, attitudes toward asthma, self-efficacy, perception of barriers, and self-management behaviors, asthma control and quality of life over time among peer leaders.\n3. To test the following hypothesis:\n\n   * Adolescents participating in a peer-assisted asthma camp program will report improved knowledge, attitudes toward asthma, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors, decreased perception of barriers, and increased asthma control and quality of life at 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention compared with the adult-led camp group.\n4. To examine the moderating effect of personal factors (e.g., age, sex, socioeconomic status, race, illness status, family support) on intervention outcomes such as self-management behaviors, asthma control and quality of life in adolescents with asthma.\n5. To examine the effect of the peer-assisted camp program on self-reported health care utilization including emergency department visits, days of hospitalization, outpatient visits by comparing between baseline and 9-months post-camp data and between the peer-led camp and the adult-camp programs."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Adolescents", "Peer leader program", "asthma camp", "asthma control", "quality of life", "self-efficacy", "knowledge", "attitudes", "barrier perceptions"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 126, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "peer-led asthma self-managment program", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Peer-assisted asthma self-management program"]}, {"label": "Adult-led asthma self-management program", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Adult-led asthma self-management program"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Peer-assisted asthma self-management program", "description": "Intervention group: An asthma self-management program (Power Breathing\u2122) was implemented by trained peer leaders at an asthma day camp.
