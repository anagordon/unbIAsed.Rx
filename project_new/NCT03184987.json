This study has 3 study periods: Run-in, Treatment period and a Follow-up period. Eligible subjects who meet the pre-defined criteria at screening (Visit 1) will enter into a 2-week run-in period. Subjects will continue their pre-screening inhaled medications for asthma (ICS+LABA or ICS+LABA+LAMA) without any change in regimen/dosage until day before Visit 2. At Visit 2 subjects will be allocated to either FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 or FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 micrograms (mcg) treatment depending on the asthma control status for 52 weeks. Switching medication from FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 to FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 will be permitted in accordance with the control status of the subject assessed by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-7 at Week 24 of the treatment period.
