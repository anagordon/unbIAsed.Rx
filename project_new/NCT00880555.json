An important question to be addressed is whether changes in function are better predicted by the neuropsychological tests or by the brain scan. Participants will undergo a single MRI scan, baseline financial capacity instrument (FCI) and cognitive evaluation, and then will be followed approximately annually to repeat the functional and cognitive assessments.
