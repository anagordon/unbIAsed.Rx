Eliciting personal experiences is an effective way for patients to communicate their cultural values and beliefs. This study will assess how to integrate the patients' personal experience narratives into the electronic health record (EHR). The primary hypothesis is that the implementation of a patient-centered intervention to elicit personal experiences that are included in the EHR will improve patient-provider communication and patients' QoL.", "detailedDescription": "Racial and ethnic minority patients with a Life Limiting Illnes (LLI) in the United States are underserved in many ways, including quality of palliative care. Specific disparities have been reported in palliative care for minority patients, including sub-optimal patient-provider communication and resulting lower QoL. A potential approach to improve communication is to elicit patients' personal narratives that address their cultural or spiritual values and beliefs, and include them in the EHR. The objective of this observational study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a palliative care nursing intervention designed to 1) identify barriers and facilitators for eliciting and recording relevant narratives from the perspectives of the key stakeholders: minority patients with LLI; 2) to conduct usability testing, applying a user-system-environment evaluation process to determine essential requirements for integration of the patient-centered narratives into the EHR; and 3) identify barriers and facilitators of integration of the patient's narrative into daily workflow from the perspectives of key stakeholders: acute care bedside nurse."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["COPD", "Heart Failure", "Cancer"], "keywords": ["Psychosocial", "Underserved", "Palliative", "Electronic Health Record", "Narrative"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "OTHER", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 38, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Inpatient Participants", "description": "Patients admitted to University of Colorado Hospital with at least one of the following diagnoses:\n\n* Heart Failure\n* COPD\n* Cancer", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Storytelling Intervention for Patient Participants"]}, {"label": "Nurse Participants", "description": "Bedside nurses who provide care at the inpatient level for the following diseases:\n\n* Heart Failure\n* COPD\n* Cancer", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Storytelling Intervention for Nurse Participants"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Storytelling Intervention for Patient Participants", "description": "The storytelling intervention consists of an audio-recorded interview with each patient participant prompted the participant to share their story with questions such as: tell me about your illness, tell me how your illness has affected your emotions, relationships, and spirituality.
