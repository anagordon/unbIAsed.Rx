Treatment medication will be administered as follows: ciclesonide will be inhaled once daily, using one of the two dose levels versus placebo together with other corticosteroids used as intermittent treatment. The study duration consists of a baseline period (3 to 4 weeks) and a treatment period (12 months). The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.", "detailedDescription": "The drug being tested in this study is called ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is being tested to treat children who have mild asthma.\n\nThe study enrolled 240 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):\n\n* Ciclesonide 100 \u00b5g\n* Ciclesonide 200 \u00b5g\n* Placebo (dummy inactive inhalation) - this is a metered-dose inhaler that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient.\n\nAll participants were asked to take two puffs from a metered-dose inhaler once daily, in the evening, for up to 12 months.\n\nThis multi-center trial was conducted in Canada, Hungary and South Africa. The overall time to participate in this study was 12 months preceded by a baseline washout period of 3 to 4 weeks.
