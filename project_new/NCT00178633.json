Adults (\\>18)from diverse ethnic backgrounds, with clinically severe obesity, are eligible to be evaluated for bariatric weight loss surgery in the UTHBSC. Candidates considered for the study are patients who not only fulfill the criteria for weight loss surgery, but also demonstrate a high likelihood of complying with the long-term follow-up that is required for a successful study.\n\nPatients who have components of the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) will be included if these complications do not preclude a safe operation. .\n\nExclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria include age over 70 years, current history of smoking, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, known peripheral vascular disease, severe psychiatric disease, any medical problem or physical contraindication for surgery (as determined by the physician) and pregnancy. This study will be limited to adults since the safety of gastric bypass surgery has not been shown to be safe in children in large clinical trials\n\n-", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "maximumAge": "70 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"], "studyPopulation": "Male and female, adult patients with clinically severe obesity who have undergone elective bariatric surgery.", "samplingMethod": "PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"overallOfficials": [{"name": "Heinrich Taegtmeyer, MD, DPhil", "affiliation": "University of Texas, Health Sciences Center Houston", "role": "PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}], "locations": [{"facility": "University of Texas, Health Sciences Center Houston", "city": "Houston", "state": "Texas", "zip": "77030", "country": "United States", "geoPoint": {"lat": 29.76328, "lon": -95.36327}}]}, "referencesModule": {"references": [{"pmid": "17138229", "type": "RESULT", "citation": "Leichman JG, Aguilar D, King TM, Mehta S, Majka C, Scarborough T, Wilson EB, Taegtmeyer H.
