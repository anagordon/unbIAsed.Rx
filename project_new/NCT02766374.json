Biofeedback is a treatment method that can teach how to bodily control. Biofeedback is widely used to help people relax. In this study however, the investigators want to learn if a specific type of biofeedback actually improves asthma in a way that might allow the reduction or elimination of other controller treatments like inhaled-corticosteroids.", "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) in asthma management as either a controller (alternative) or bronchodilator (complementary) treatment, with respect to the current treatment of choice, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, using different methods from participants that demonstrated clinically significant improvement in asthma outcomes in the investigator's previous research (1), and adding a second site not involved in the investigator's previous work.\n\nInflammation of airways is viewed as the core pathophysiologic process in asthma. It is thought to render airways more reactive, and therefore, more susceptible to bronchoconstriction, leading to asthma exacerbations. Asthma is an episodic disease, where the goal of therapy is to reduce susceptibility to exacerbations, which may cause severe, even life-threatening illness. Anti-inflammatory medications reduce airways reactivity, while bronchodilator medications primarily relieve symptoms once an asthma exacerbation is in process, and may stop progressive constriction of airway smooth muscles (ASM). An anti-inflammatory effect of HRV-BF would have important implications for asthma management because adherence to ICS regimens is low due to a significant degree to feared side effects of prolonged steroid medication. Even if HRV-BF is found to only allow partial reduction in ICS requirements, this still would likely represent a major advance in asthma care."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Biofeedback", "Heart rate variability biofeedback", "Inhaled corticosteroids"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 68, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "During the first training session, we will measure heart rate variability (HRV) amplitude while the patient breathes for two minutes at a frequency ranging between 4.5-6.5 breaths/min, providing a \"pacing stimulus\" for this purpose.
