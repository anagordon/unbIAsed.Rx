To provide pilot data on the effectiveness and safety to inform a pivotal trial.\n2. To inform population enrichment strategies\n3. To refine pivotal trial endpoints and analytical methods\n4. To identify operational challenges of study design\n5. To assess patient adherence, competence, and experience\n6.

Subjects and/or their caregivers will be trained on device preparation, placement and removal in accordance with product instructions of use (IFU). Subjects should be transitioned back to their oral maintenance diuretic regimen when clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nOver the initial 7 days, all subjects will receive daily clinic or phone follow-up by the study staff. Decision of treatment with Furoscix in the intervention arm as well as changes in oral diuretic dosing in the control arm will be determined by the treating physician in coordination with the study nurse. Safety labs will be done on Days 1, 3, 7 and 30.\n\nAfter Subjects have been transitioned to their oral maintenance diuretic regimen, additional doses of Furoscix (for Furoscix group) or IV diuretics (for Treat as Usual group) can be prescribed during the 30-day study period as needed based on the presence of congestion symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, edema, and/or excess weight gain) as determined by the investigator.\n\nThe Follow-Up Phase will include a visit to the clinic on Day 30 +/- 5 days where effectiveness and safety assessments will be performed including limited physical exam (including NYHA Class), Composite Congestion Score (CCS), 5-point Current Dyspnea Score, 7-point Dyspnea Score, vital signs, laboratory analyses, KCCQ-12, Visual Analog Score (VAS), 6MWT and adverse events."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 63, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Furoscix Infusor", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Furoscix (furosemide injection, 8 mg/mL) administered subcutaneously over 5 hours via the Furoscix Infusor.
