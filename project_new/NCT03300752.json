However, as many as 64% of adults have uncontrolled asthma; minorities are disproportionately represented within that population. While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are a safe and effective treatment for uncontrolled asthma, relative to Whites, Blacks have lower rates of ICS adherence.\n\nBlack adults with uncontrolled asthma experience profound health disparities. Despite data that point to the critical need for enhanced asthma self-management, rates of controlled asthma are well below Healthy People 2020 targets, particularly among vulnerable populations. This Brief Evaluation of Asthma Therapy (BREATHE) intervention has the potential to offer a new avenue to asthma control via shared decision-making that supports ICS adherence."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 80, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "BREATHE Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The patient's primary care provider (PCP) will deliver the active intervention (shared decision-making discussion of asthma control status and treatment) - BREATHE Intervention.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: BREATHE Intervention"]}, {"label": "Control Intervention", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "The patient's primary care provider (PCP) will deliver the control intervention (discussion of healthy lifestyles).", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Control Intervention"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "BREATHE Intervention", "description": "PCPs randomized to BREATHE will receive the tablet which, when the screen is advanced by the PCP, will prompt the PCP through a 7-minute, 4-step brief intervention tailored to respond to the patient's specific beliefs, and shared decision-making discussion of asthma control status and treatment.", "armGroupLabels": ["BREATHE Intervention"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Control Intervention", "description": "PCP will provide discussion of healthy lifestyles.", "armGroupLabels": ["Control Intervention"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score", "description": "Full title: Asthma Control Questionnaire Construct measured: self-reported asthma control Scoring: 0 points = total asthma control/ best outcome, 6 points = completely uncontrolled asthma/ worst outcome", "timeFrame": "Baseline, 1 Month, 2 Months, 3 Months (post-intervention)"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score", "description": "Full title: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire Construct: quality of life for patients with asthma Scoring: 32 items, each scored 1-7.
