Older patients with heart failure and their family caregivers, rarely have access to palliative supportive care services because the disease is unpredictable and palliative treatment may not be provided until after other medical treatments have been tried. Investigators are studying whether palliative care provided when advanced heart failure patients are still well will result in better quality of life, mood and less symptom distress compared to usual or standard heart failure care.\n\nSpecific Aims and Hypotheses:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Determine whether ENABLE CHF-PC leads to higher advanced heart failure patient-reported quality of life (QOL) and mood (depression/anxiety); and lower symptom burden and resource use (e.g. hospital admissions and days, emergency visits) through 16 weeks post baseline.\n\n\u2022 Hypothesis 1: Intervention participants will experience higher QOL and mood, and lower symptom burden and resource use through 16 weeks post baseline compared with those receiving usual HF care.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine whether ENABLE CHF-PC leads to higher caregiver-reported QOL, mood (anxiety/depression), and self-reported health and lower caregiver burden through 16 weeks post baseline.\n\n\u2022 Hypothesis 2: Intervention caregivers will report higher QOL, mood, and self-reported health, and lower caregiver burden through 16 weeks post baseline.", "detailedDescription": "As described."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 573, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Active Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Behavioral: behavioral support\n\nUsual HF Care + ENABLE CHF-PC", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Behavioral Support"]}, {"label": "Usual HF Care", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Usual heart failure care includes any available supportive care resources and heart failure patient medical management based on national HF guidelines.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Usual HF Care"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Behavioral Support", "description": "ENABLE CHF-PC includes:\n\n1.
