In this study uncontrolled patients who are steroid-naive or on low dose inhaled corticosteroids will be treated with Seretide (salmeterol/fluticasone combination, SFC) 50/250 \u00b5g twice daily. The asthma control test (ACT) will be used to detect differences in the level of asthma control during treatment. The study aims to show a correlation between improvements of ACT und the level of asthma control which will be reached by the patients.\n\nThe aim of the study is to show that most of symptomatic asthma patients can reach 'well controlled asthma' with SFC. We get information about ACT in daily practice and physicians are trained to use the asthma control test as a screening tool and for follow up of asthma management.
