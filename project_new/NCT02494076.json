A novel way of treating asthma is the use of positive expiratory pressure (PEP). Positive expiratory pressure works by creating pressure in the lungs to keep airways open and to clear mucus from the lungs. PEP is already used in the treatment of asthma at the investigators institution, but studies evaluating the efficacy of PEP therapy in asthma exacerbations do not exist. This study plans to learn more about the use of PEP therapy in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children in the emergency department. Specifically, the study aims to evaluate if PEP therapy reduces the severity of asthma exacerbations in children and if it reduces the need for additional therapies and admission to the hospital. This study will be a randomized control trial comparing children who receive standard therapy to those who receive standard therapy plus PEP therapy in the treatment of asthma exacerbations. Children age 2 to 18 years presenting to the ED with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations will be included in the study. Reduction in clinical asthma severity will be measured by change in the Pulmonary Asthma Score (the respiratory severity score used at the investigators institution). The need for additional therapies and hospitalization will also be evaluated."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 52, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "EzPAP", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients randomized to the EzPAP arm will receive first-line therapies and PEP therapy via EzPAP.
