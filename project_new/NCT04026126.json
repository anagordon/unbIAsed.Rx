The following aims are proposed: Aim 1: to determine if chronic heat therapy results in improvements in cardiovascular function. Aim 2: To examine potential mechanism(s) of action of heat therapy in cardiovascular function.", "detailedDescription": "The National Institute of Health recognizes heart failure as a major public health problem with a prevalence of over 5.8 million Americans and 23 million people worldwide. Commonly prescribed medications to treat the symptoms associated with this disease are expensive and many are not covered by major health insurance companies. There is a critical need to develop novel treatment and prevention strategies for heart failure. Emerging research highlights the benefits of heat therapy (HT) on metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. The Geiger laboratory has demonstrated that in obese rats fed a high- fat diet for 12 weeks, weekly HT restored whole body glucose tolerance and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. The first comprehensive investigation of long-term HT in young, sedentary humans resulted in improved endothelial function and hemodynamics that were on par with what is typically observed with exercise training in previously sedentary subjects. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if the enhanced endothelial arterial distensibility observed with HT translates into improved cardiorespiratory fitness. The following aims are proposed:\n\nAim 1: To determine if chronic HT results in improvements in cardiovascular function. The study team hypothesizes that repeated HT will result in improvement in hemodynamic variables related to arterial distensibility (blood pressure, stroke volume, stroke volume variation, cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance) and that these changes translate to improved cardiovascular function as measured by VO2max.\n\nAim 2: To examine potential mechanism(s) of action of HT in cardiovascular function. The study team hypothesizes that HT may exerts its beneficial effects via the effect of heat shock proteins (HSPs) on Nitric Oxide (NO) bioavailability. This will be tested by measuring HSPs, NO mediators and inflammatory markers at baseline and post-intervention. There is rapidly growing interest in the use of HT as a global therapeutic approach and alternative or complementary therapy to exercise training for patients with chronic disease. Study findings would be clinically significant as both men and women with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (as indicated by maximal oxygen consumption, VO2max) are at lower risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThese studies will be the first to examine the ability of chronic heat therapy to increase cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by maximal oxygen consumption, VO2max. These findings could lead to HT as a simple and effective tool for improving cardiovascular health in a variety of populations, particularly those with exercise limitations and comorbid disease states like type 2 diabetes, dementia and cardiovascular disease."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure", "Heart Diseases", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Endothelial Dysfunction"], "keywords": ["Heat Therapy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 15, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Heat Therapy Treatment", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "This study will recruit subjects to participate in heat therapy treatment at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC).
