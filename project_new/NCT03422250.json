Brain network stimulation will be carried out with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Target networks will be the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). Twenty AD and 20 bvFTD patients will be recruited and assessed with a comprehensive clinical, behavioral and cognitive battery, and 3 Tesla MRI scan (including resting-state functional MRI, arterial spin labeling, diffusion tensor imaging, structural MRI) at three time-points: baseline, after tDCS, and after 6 months. Patients will be randomized to 2 arms: anodal stimulation of the disease-specific network (DMN in AD, SN in bvFTD) or cathodal stimulation of the anti-correlated network (SN in AD, DMN in bvFTD). The intervention will consist of 10 tDCS sessions over two weeks. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected at baseline for biomarker's assessment; blood samples will be collected at each time-point to assess changes in peripheral inflammatory markers. Blood and CSF collection will be optional. A sample of 20 elderly controls will be included for baseline comparisons."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Alzheimer's Disease", "Frontotemporal Dementia, Behavioral Variant"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 45, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Arm 1", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Alzheimer's disease (AD): anodal tDCS of the default mode network (DMN)", "interventionNames": ["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]}, {"label": "Arm 2", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Alzheimer's disease (AD): cathodal tDCS of the salience network (SN)", "interventionNames": ["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]}, {"label": "Arm 3", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD): anodal tDCS of the salience network (SN)", "interventionNames": ["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]}, {"label": "Arm 4", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD): cathodal tDCS of the default mode network (DMN)", "interventionNames": ["Device: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)", "description": "10 daily 25-minutes tDCS sessions over two weeks.", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm 1", "Arm 2", "Arm 3", "Arm 4"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Clinical Disease Severity (CDR)", "description": "CDR - Clinical Dementia Rating score\n\nThe clinical dementia rating (CDR) is a clinical global rating scale administered to both the participant and the caregiver, assessing 6 domains of participant function: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care.
