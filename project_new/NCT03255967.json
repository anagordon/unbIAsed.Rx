While many persons with dementia are cared for by friends and family in the community with the assistance of home healthcare, most home healthcare clinicians and agencies are ill prepared to care for this population and therefore have difficulty assisting patients and caregivers in maintaining quality of life leading to adverse patient outcomes, increased caregiver stress and burnout, and healthcare utilization. This study will therefore utilize a cluster randomized controlled design at 3 study sites to examine the ability of a multi-component evidence-based practice primary palliative care quality improvement program for home healthcare registered nurses, occupational therapists and physical therapists to improve the quality of life and reduce healthcare utilization for persons with dementia and their informal caregiver."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dementia"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 217, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "QI program care", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "DSM-H performance improvement program Patients in the performance improvement group will receive care from a care team who has received the DSM-H performance improvement program", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: DSM-H"]}, {"label": "Control", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Receive usual care from a care team who has not received the performance improvement program", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Standard of Care"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "DSM-H", "description": "Multi-modal quality improvement program for improving the quality of care provided to person with dementia (PWD)-informal caregiver dyads through HHC", "armGroupLabels": ["QI program care"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Standard of Care", "description": "Subjects receive care through usual home healthcare assignment process.", "armGroupLabels": ["Control"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Score", "description": "13-item measurement of Alzheimer's disease patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by proxy (caregiver) assessment.
