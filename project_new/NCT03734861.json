Additionally, current absence of a gold standard to measure adherence forces clinicians and researchers to rely on patient-self report, which is notoriously inaccurate, to support clinical decision making. Many young patients suffer from both intentional and non-intentional non-adherence, thus an appropriate intervention must address both types. Current studies using electronic monitoring devices (EMDs) primarily focus on non-intentional non-adherence through reminder systems and thus are limited in their ability to engage patients for long-term behavior change.\n\nThis trial addresses an important knowledge gap by evaluating whether EMDs with a combination of reminder system and patient education can prove to be effective in increasing adherence rates and can be used in clinical practice to achieve better asthma control and outcomes through improved patient and clinician engagement.", "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study of children with persistent asthma who are managed on daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). 75 children will be randomized 2:1 into one of two arms:\n\n* 50 children will be randomized to BreatheSmart, comprised of:\n\n  * BreatheSmart mobile application that tracks medication usage and sends real time reminders\n  * HeroTracker sensor that counts dosage and monitors real-time medication adherence\n  * CoheroConnect provider portal that allows the Investigator to monitor real-time adherence and to provide targeted outreach to children with low adherence (intervention arm)\n* 25 children will be randomized to \"standard of care\"(control arm).
