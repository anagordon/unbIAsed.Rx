A cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) for longitudinal data will be fit using a maximum likelihood structural equation model (SEM) in order to explore longitudinal mediation between asthma outcomes (asthma control, spirometry, quality of life (QOL)) and depressive symptoms. CLPM will test whether caregiver improvement preceded child asthma improvement, and SEM will test whether improved adherence and/or decreased child anxiety/depression mediated the effect. The investigators considered a randomized control trial, but it would not be ethically acceptable to withhold medication from caregivers diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) for the proposed one-year duration of the study. It is unlikely that potential participants in the study would find this acceptable. Furthermore a controlled design is not necessary since the investigators are not testing the efficacy of antidepressants for depression, but rather the impact of improvement on caregiver depression on the child.", "detailedDescription": "Caregiver will be consented for his/her and the child's participation.
