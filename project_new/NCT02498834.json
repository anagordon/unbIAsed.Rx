This application is based on Social Cognitive Theory. Self-confidence or self-efficacy is a central component of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) Application of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) in asthma populations has shown that technical advice from providers is one external factor that can improve asthma management self-efficacy. Additionally, personal beliefs, such as outcome expectations, and family factors, such as parent and adolescent responsibility for asthma self-management, have been shown to affect adolescent self-efficacy and disease management outcomes. Prior work has found that adolescent self-efficacy in asthma management correlates strongly with health status, adherence, asthma medication device technique, asthma symptoms, and impact of illness on the family.\n\nAll adolescents will have their medical visits audio recorded. The adolescent will be interviewed after his/her medical visit while his/her caregiver/parent completes a survey at the time of study enrollment. This same procedure will be used when the adolescent and caregiver/parents return for the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Communication", "provider", "caregiver", "adolescent"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 359, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Educational Video and Question Prompt List", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Parents and adolescents in this group will watch a short educational video in English or Spanish on an iPad about the importance of encouraging adolescents to ask questions and to be involved during their pediatric asthma visits to improve their self-management skills.
