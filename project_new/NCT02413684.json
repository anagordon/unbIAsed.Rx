Current patient engagement strategies only focus on the patient-physician interaction and have been shown to be ineffective.\n\nThe need for a comprehensive approach to patient engagement is no different among patients with asthma as it is in any other chronic condition. Patients with asthma must make complicated health decisions daily that impact their social and occupational activities, quality of life, and treatment adherence. Obtaining, communicating, processing, and understanding non- biased health information are crucial in making appropriate and informed treatment decisions.\n\nPack Health LLC and Duke will develop a patient engagement toolkit known as \"Packs\" to help empower and engage patients.
