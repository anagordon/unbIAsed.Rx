Numerous efficacy trials have shown that HF care management supported by health information technology (i.e., HITCM) can improve patients' outcomes, although VA care managers in 'real-world' health systems are often overwhelmed by the need to provide monitoring and behavior change services. Informal caregivers may help to fill the gaps in VA care management and enhance support for patients' treatment adherence, behavior changes, and symptom monitoring. The challenge will be to identify ways to leverage assistance from informal caregivers (ICGs) who lack the resources to fill this role effectively.\n\nObjectives: We will evaluate the impact of extending the reach of HITCM by incorporating a protocol-driven model for improved monitoring and self-management support by a CarePartner (CP). CPs will be adult children or friends living outside the patient's home who are willing to play a structured role to support self-care. The specific aims of the trial are: (1) to determine whether an intervention that uses automated patient monitoring and behavior change calls with follow-up to HF patients' care manager and CP (HITCM+CP) improves key patient-centered outcomes relative to a system that only uses the same technology to support patients' care management (HITCM-only). Outcomes of interest include patients' health-related quality of life, mental health, health service use, and mortality risk; (2) to evaluate the impact of HITCM+CP on patients' self-care behaviors compared to HITCM-only; and (3) to determine whether the intervention increases the quality and quantity of support for HF patients' self-care compared to HITCM-only.\n\nMethods: 372 HF patient-CP pairs will be recruited from the VA Louis Stokes (Cleveland) Healthcare System. Patients will receive automated telephone assessment and behavior change calls weekly for 12 months. For patients in both study arms, a care manager will monitor patients' assessment results via a secure website and will receive reports concerning urgent health problems by fax and pager. In the HITCM+CP group, patients' CPs also will receive tailored e-mail reports based on patients' weekly assessments. HITCM+CP patients and their CPs will use a structured protocol to review the patient's assessment results, identify self-care goals and barriers, and ensure that the patient's in-home caregivers and healthcare team remain involved. All patients and CPs will complete quantitative surveys at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The study will include a mixed-methods approach including qualitative interviews with patients, CPs and clinicians to evaluate intervention use and the service's potential for translation. The primary outcome will be HF-related quality of life at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include self-care behavior, patient-CP relationship indicators, hospitalization, and death.\n\nImpact: This study will evaluate a model for leveraging ICGs and structuring their role in HF patients' overall disease management. If effective, the service may provide the frequent monitoring and behavior change assistance that patients need, allowing VA to extend its impact beyond what current care management programs can realistically deliver."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure, Congestive"], "keywords": ["Health Information Technology", "Patient Care Management", "Self Care", "Quality of Life", "Family or non-Family Informal Caregivers"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 372, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Arm 1", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Veterans with heart failure that can identify an out-of-home informal caregiver", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: HITCM+CP"]}, {"label": "Arm 2", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Veterans with heart failure that can identify an out-of-home informal caregiver", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: HITCM only"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "HITCM+CP", "description": "Weekly automated assessment calls with follow-up by a care manager and a CarePartner for 12 months.
