While our study primarily will target HF dyads, if the investigators encounter recruitment difficulties, unaccompanied HF patients (i.e., HF patients who do not have a family member who can participate in the study with them) will also be enrolled.\n\nProcedures (methods): Single group pre-post study design.\n\nAfter providing informed consent, HF patients or dyads will receive the prompt list while in the waiting room prior to their visit. Completing the prompt list involves two steps. In step 1, participants will independently select from a predetermined list of questions (within topic areas) that they would like to ask their health care provider. The questions/topics were developed by other HF patients and family members in another phase of the study. Also, patients will be asked to choose behaviors they would like their family member to engage in during the visit (e.g., write down the provider's instructions, ask questions), from a structured list developed based on prior research. Family members will identify which behaviors they are willing to perform. In step 2, patients or dyads will collectively prioritize which questions/topics to discuss during the visit. Each dyad member will receive a prompt list to complete in the clinic waiting room immediately before their appointment.\n\nAll visits will be audio-taped to assess effects of the intervention on communication behaviors during the visit. All participants will complete a questionnaire at baseline, 2 days after the audio-taped clinic visit, and at 3 months."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "Individual patients and dyads (i.e., a HF patient and family member) will receive the question/topic prompt list immediately before their clinic visit", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE", "maskingDescription": "Given the nature of the intervention and it's intended purpose (i.e., to enhance communication with participants and health care providers), it is not possible to blind participants, care providers, or the investigators."}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 53, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Question/Topic Prompt List", "type": "OTHER", "description": "The Question/Topic Prompt List is provided to HF Patients and their family member (if applicable) for completion prior to being seen by the doctor.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Question/Topic Prompt List"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Question/Topic Prompt List", "description": "A written document containing suggested questions that the family member and/or patient may want to ask the health care provider during the visit.
