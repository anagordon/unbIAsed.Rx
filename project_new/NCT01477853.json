Following a single-blind placebo run-in period, participants were to be randomized to one of three treatment arms (sitagliptin monotherapy, atorvastatin monotherapy, or sitagliptin plus atorvastatin) for 16 weeks (Phase A). During Phase B of the study (Weeks 16 through 54), participants were to receive either sitagliptin plus atorvastatin or glimepiride plus atorvastatin.
