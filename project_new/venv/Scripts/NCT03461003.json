Pediatric hypertension specialists lack an evidentiary base on which to establish definitive clinical practice guidelines for first-line therapy. Significant practice variation is an unsurprising consequence. Routine choice of the same first-line therapy for most patients with hypertension, absent testing other options, may delay correction of blood pressure for months or years. Failure to incorporate patient preferences in medical decision-making may also contribute to decreased patient satisfaction and adherence.\n\nLarge parallel-group, comparative effectiveness trials are likely not on the horizon for this population. Moreover, heterogeneity of treatment effects would minimize the generalizability of such a trial to all patients.\n\nThis is a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial to compare the n-of-1 trial approach to usual care in normalizing blood pressure while minimizing exposure to compliance-reducing side effects."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Pediatric Hypertension"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 49, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "NICHE method", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "In the NICHE method, antihypertensive therapy will be chosen using an n-of-1 trial to identify the preferred therapy.
