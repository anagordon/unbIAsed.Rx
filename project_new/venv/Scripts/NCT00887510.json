Along with lifestyle changes, various medications are currently used to treat people with hypertension. Some of these medications, however, may affect the way the body handles sugar, essentially preventing the body from breaking down sugar and predisposing people to developing diabetes. People who have metabolic syndrome-a condition primarily characterized by an increased waist measurement, abnormal blood lipid levels, hypertension, and high blood sugar levels-are already at risk of developing diabetes. In these people, taking the antihypertensive medications that prevent sugar breakdown may further increase their risk of diabetes. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of how people with metabolic syndrome respond to antihypertensive medications that alter the body's ability to break down sugar.", "detailedDescription": "Treatment for hypertension includes lifestyle changes and medications. Examples of some antihypertensive medications include diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and vasodilators. Mounting research suggests that certain antihypertensive medications, such as thiazide diuretics, are associated with metabolic disturbances that result in increased glucose intolerance, while other antihypertensive medications, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, appear to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. The influence of these medications may be especially critical in people with metabolic syndrome, who are already at risk of developing glucose intolerance and diabetes. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of how people with metabolic syndrome respond to antihypertensive medications that alter the body's ability to break down sugar. The long-term goal of the study is to determine the best antihypertensive medications for people who have both metabolic syndrome and hypertension so as to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes in this population.\n\nParticipation in this study will last 18 weeks and involve four study visits. Participants will be randomly assigned to initially receive 6 weeks of treatment with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), which is a thiazide diuretic, or trandolapril, which is an ACE inhibitor. Both medications are FDA-approved for treating hypertension. After 6 weeks of treatment, if participants' blood pressure levels are not too low, they will add the second medication so that they are taking both HCTZ and trandolapril for the next 6 weeks, until Week 12. At Week 12, again if participants' blood pressure levels are not too low, they will then take only the second medication for the last 6 weeks. The four study visits will occur at baseline and after each of the three 6-week treatment periods (Weeks 6, 12, and 18). All study visits will include blood pressure and pulse measurements, urine and blood sampling, oral glucose tolerance testing, and questions about diet and exercise habits. The first and last study visits will also include a physical examination and a medical history review. Some of the blood collected during the first study visit will be used for genetic testing. There will be no follow-up visits."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Hypertension"], "keywords": ["Metabolic Syndrome", "High Blood Pressure", "Abdominal Obesity", "Impaired Glucose Tolerance"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 24, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Thiazide First", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Participants will receive 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) each day for 6 weeks, followed by 25 mg of HCTZ every day plus 4 mg of trandolapril each day for 6 weeks, followed by 4 mg trandolapril each day for 6 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Hydrochlorothiazide", "Drug: Trandolapril"]}, {"label": "Trandolapril First", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Participants will receive 4 mg of trandolapril each day for 6 weeks, followed by 4 mg of trandolapril for 6 weeks plus 25 mg of HCTZ each day for 6 weeks, followed by 25 mg of HCTZ each day for 6 weeks.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Hydrochlorothiazide", "Drug: Trandolapril"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Hydrochlorothiazide", "description": "25 mg tablet once daily for 6 weeks\n\nOther Names:\n\nHCTZ", "armGroupLabels": ["Thiazide First", "Trandolapril First"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Trandolapril", "description": "4 mg tablet once daily for 6 weeks", "armGroupLabels": ["Thiazide First", "Trandolapril First"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) Area Under Curve (AUC) After Addition of Trandolapril to Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Compared With Change in OGTT AUC After Addition of HCTZ to Trandolapril", "description": "Comparing the change in OGTT AUC rand 1 visit4-visit 3 with rand 2 visit 3-2.
