Participants will be recruited from GHESKIO's HIV clinic. Eligible individuals will complete informed consent and be randomized to early HTN treatment vs. SOC. Participants in early HTN treatment will initiate amlodipine immediately versus those in SOC will initiate amlodipine only if they meet the HTN threshold (SBP \u2265140 or DBP \u226590 mmHg) during the study period. All participants will be followed for 12 months.", "detailedDescription": "The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate antihypertensive treatment among people living with HIV (PLWH) with pre-hypertension (pre-HTN) at GHESKIO. This study will provide critical data on the feasibility, benefits and risks of antihypertensive treatment for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention among PLWH with pre-HTN that will inform a future definitive trial powered for incident CVD events.\n\nFor the pilot study, the investigators will enroll 250 PLWH (18-65 years of age) who have been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for \u2265 1 years with viral suppression within past 12 months and SBP 120-139 or DBP 80-89 mm Hg and no current antihypertensive treatment; randomize them to \"early HTN treatment\" or the current standard of care (SOC); and follow them for 12 months. Amlodipine is the recommended first-line anti-hypertensive medication according to Haiti's new primary care HTN guidelines. Participants in the early HTN treatment arm will initiate amlodipine 5 mg immediately, increasing to 10 mg if SBP \\>130 mm Hg after 1 month. Participants in the SOC arm will initiate amlodipine only if they develop HTN (SBP \u2265140 or DBP \u226590 mm Hg).\n\nParticipants that meet study eligibility criteria will proceed to study enrollment visit (\\~90 min). Participants will be randomized to early HTN treatment vs. SOC in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random assignment. The research nurse will collect demographic and clinical data, administer a baseline questionnaire, measure unobserved BP, and perform an ECG. The questionnaire includes a CVD medical history, family history, medications, CVD health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, and diet) using validated questions that have been used at GHESKIO and are comparable to those used in US cohorts. Enrollment labs (\\~15ml of venous blood) including HgbA1c, total cholesterol, high density cholesterol, CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) cell count, and HIV viral load (unless available from electronic medical record in the past 6 months) will be collected. Samples of serum and plasma will be stored for future studies, with documented consent from participants. The study physician will interpret the ECG and perform an echocardiogram and vascular ultrasound.\n\nStudy drug will be dispensed to participants randomized to the early treatment arm with appropriate education and counseling on adherence and potential side effects. Amlodipine will be started at 5mg at enrollment and increased to 10mg if SBP \\>130 mm Hg after 1 month for participants in the early treatment arm. Locator and contact information will be verified and follow up appointment given.\n\nAfter enrollment and randomization assignment (including amlodipine initiation), participants will have follow-up visits either at GHESKIO (months 0.5-1, 3, 6, 9, 12) or in the community / home with community health workers (months 2, 5, 8). All visits will include BP measurement, lifestyle counseling, adherence encouragement, and assessment of adverse events. The GHESKIO visits will also include a physical exam. Participants in the early intervention arm will receive monthly amlodipine refills. Participants in the SOC arm will initiate amlodipine only if they develop hypertension (SBP \\>140 or DBP \\>90 mm Hg).\n\nAt the 12-month study visit, participants will also complete a brief questionnaire about changes in health behaviors and have viral load measured. Participants may return to the HIV clinic at any time for symptoms, questions, or other concerns, and a BP measurement will be taken at each of these encounters. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit. Medical record abstraction will be done by research staff for any hospitalization or death among a participant."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["HIV/AIDS", "Pre Hypertension"], "keywords": ["hypertension", "HIV"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 250, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention (Early hypertension)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants randomized to the early HTN treatment arm will initiate 5mg daily of amlodipine immediately, increasing to 10 mg if SBP \\>130 mmHg after 1 month.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Amlodipine 5mg"]}, {"label": "Standard of Care", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Participants randomized to the SOC arm will not be initiated on any medications initially.
