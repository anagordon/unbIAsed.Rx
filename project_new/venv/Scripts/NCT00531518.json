Those at higher risk will be treated with anti-psychotic, antidepressant and mood stabilizing medications by symptom indications, and systematically provided psychoeducational multifamily group treatment, supported education and employment, and intensive clinical case management, using key elements of Assertive Community Treatment. Both arms of the study will be followed for two years and assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months. Outcome measures include rates of conversion to psychosis, relapse of psychosis, development of psychotic disorder diagnoses, levels of positive, negative and general symptoms, social and vocational functioning, family functioning, and neurocognitive functioning.\n\nThe six sites include Sacramento, California; Salem Oregon; and surrounding counties, Ypsilanti and Washtenaw County, Michigan; Portland, Maine; Albuquerque, New Mexico and Glen Oaks, New York.\n\nIn addition to symptomatic and functional outcomes, impact on incidence of psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, will be assessed, as will cost-benefit effects."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Schizophrenia", "Bipolar Disorder", "Depression", "Psychotic Disorders"], "keywords": ["Schizophrenia", "Bipolar disorder", "Psychosis", "Prodromal psychosis", "Family psychoeducation", "Supported education", "Supported employment", "Ulra-high-risk for psychosis", "Major depression", "Bipolar disorder, with psychotic features", "Major depression, with psychotic features", "Attenuated, prodromal psychotic symptoms"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 292, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Control group", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "This is the control arm.
