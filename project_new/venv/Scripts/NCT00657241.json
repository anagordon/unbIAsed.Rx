There is also continuing interest in combining angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACE inhibitors in hypertension based on the unsubstantiated belief that \"more complete\" renin-angiotensin system inhibition is desirable. It is more attractive physiologically to combine a long-acting \u03b2-blocker with vasodilatory actions (carvedilol CR) with an ACE inhibitor because this combination addresses more directly the two fundamental hemodynamic changes needed to reduce CVD events: lowering systolic BP (afterload) and lowering heart rate; the product of the two is a reliable surrogate for reduced cardiac work. In fact, clinical trial data suggest that there is no appreciable additional BP lowering when ARBs are added to ACE inhibitors and neither class lowers heart rate. The present proposal is designed to demonstrate the superior \"cardioprotection\" of carvedilol CR compared to ARB (valsartan) when each is added to background ACE inhibitor therapy. Principal dependent variables include ambulatory cardiac work (24-hour mean ambulatory systolic BP x heart rate) and laboratory stress responses (central systolic time-tension indices derived from arterial tonometry pre- and post-bicycle exercise). Secondary hemodynamic variables will define changes in flow and pressure (e.g. central systolic BP and forward and reflected pressure wave estimations)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Hypertension"], "keywords": ["cardiac work", "carvedilol CR", "valsartan", "tonometry"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "interventionModelDescription": "Run-in period with lisinopril is followed by random entry into valsartan followed by carvedilol CR or carvedilol CR followed by valsartan", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "maskingDescription": "Drugs names omitted on patient bottles", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 30, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "(A) ARB first, beta-blocker second", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Valsartan 160 mg daily (one week) and valsartan 320 mg daily (3 weeks) followed by carvedilol CR 20 mg daily (one week) and carvedilol CR 40 mg daily (3 weeks)", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Carvedilol CR", "Drug: Valsartan"]}, {"label": "(B) Beta-blocker first, ARB second", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "carvedilol CR 20 mg daily (one week) and carvedilol CR 40 mg daily (3 weeks) followed by valsartan 160 mg daily (1 week) and valsartan 320 mg daily (3 weeks).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Carvedilol CR", "Drug: Valsartan"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Carvedilol CR", "armGroupLabels": ["(A) ARB first, beta-blocker second", "(B) Beta-blocker first, ARB second"], "otherNames": ["Coreg CR"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Valsartan", "armGroupLabels": ["(A) ARB first, beta-blocker second", "(B) Beta-blocker first, ARB second"], "otherNames": ["Diovan"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Difference in Resting CTTI Between Carvedilol CR (Beta-blocker) and Valsartan (ARB) in Combination With Lisinopril.", "description": "Cardiac time-tension index (CTTI) is a refined version of the rate-pressure product (RPP, historically systolic \\[S\\] BP x heart rate) reported by the SphygmoCor pulse wave analysis system used in this trial.
