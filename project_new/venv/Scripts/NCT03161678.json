We hypothesize that genetic variation in CES1 will significantly impact on-clopidogrel platelet aggregation while having a minimal effect in ticagrelor-treated subjects.\n\nSpecific Aim: To conduct a prospective randomized crossover study of clopidogrel and ticagrelor in healthy individuals stratified by CES1 genotype. Participants will be recruited by CES1 genotype into a randomized crossover study of clopidogrel (75 mg daily for 7d) and ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily for 7d) with extensive phenotyping including ex vivo platelet aggregometry performed pre- and post-drug administration in order to assess the interaction of genotype and drug choice on on-treatment platelet function."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Myocardial Infarction", "Thrombosis", "Platelet Dysfunction"], "keywords": ["Pharmacogenetics", "Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)", "Antiplatelet therapy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "interventionModelDescription": "Ninety healthy Amish subjects (30 CES1 G143E allele carriers, 30 carriers of a risk variant to be determined, and 30 age/sex-matched controls) will be enrolled.
