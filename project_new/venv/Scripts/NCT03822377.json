Additional antithrombotic therapy prior or during intervention plays an important role in the short- and long-term outcomes after PPCI. Oral antiplatelet therapy including a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors is a cornerstone of antithrombotic treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Prasugrel and Ticagrelor have been shown to be superior to Clopidogrel in patients with STEMI in reduction of ischemic complication without any increase in the bleeding risk and with a significant reduction in the stent thrombosis rate. Nevertheless, in STEMI patients, pharmacodynamic studies showed prasugrel and ticagrelor oral loading dose (LD) provided a suboptimal platelet inhibition in the first hours after LD, and at least 4 hours are required to achieve and effective platelet aggregation inhibition in the majority of patients, in part due to slowed gut motility caused by morphine use. Orodispersible tablet (ODT) is a different tablet formulation that disperses upon contact with the moist mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity and quickly release its components before swallowing; thus local drug dissolution and absorption as well as onset of clinical effect can be obtained conveniently easily and quickly by bypassing gastrointestinal tract. Recently, Ticagrelor 90 mg ODT has become available and bioequivalence studies on healthy volunteers documented its effectiveness with consequent approval by European Medicine Agency of this formulation which is currently available on the market. Thus, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the superiority in platelet inhibition with 180 mg Ticagrelor loading dose (LD) administered as ODTs as compared with standard formulation, among patients with STEMI or very high-risk NSTEMI undergoing immediate PCI. Primary objective consists in evaluating platelet reactivity 1 hour after Ticagrelor loading dose by VerifyNow test."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "NSTEMI - Non-ST Segment Elevation MI"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Comparison of platelet inhibition at different timepoints between 65 patients in the treatment arm (receiving orodispersible formulation of ticagrelor loading dose) versus 65 patients in the control arm (receiving standard coated formulation of ticagrelor loading dose).
