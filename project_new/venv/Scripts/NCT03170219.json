This study will evaluate a strategy of early discharge (pathway 1) or admission avoidance (pathway 2) with daily SQ furosemide compared to usual care in a population who have objective evidence of persistent congestion requiring ongoing parenteral diuretics. This will be an unblinded, randomized, controlled study of approximately 300 evaluable patients. Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1) to either:\n\nUsual care strategy, during which patients will have continued inpatient treatment and discharge follow-up as per usual standard of care plus a Day 7 phone call and Day 30 study visit.\n\nor\n\nSubcutaneous strategy, in which patients will be discharged home within 24 hours of randomization (pathway 1) or sent home from clinic or ED to receive furosemide with the SQ pump for 1-7 days (based on clinical response) plus a Day 7 and Day 30 visit.\n\nSubcutaneous furosemide/early discharge strategy:\n\nSubjects will receive device training and study materials (SQ pump device and up to a 7 day supply of SQ furosemide vials) on the day of randomization (study day 0) and discharged within 24 hours. Training will include instruction on daily weights and dyspnea numerical rating for symptoms. Scales will be provided to subjects. Subjects will be discharged with planned treatment of 80 mg SQ furosemide injection over 5-hours either QD or BID, depending on anticipated diuretic requirements. If there are unanticipated delays in discharge after randomization, subjects will continue with their assigned therapy and assessments in the hospital. Discharged subjects will receive a phone contact from study team on D1, D3, and D5 in order to assess adequacy of diuresis, persistence of congestion, and planned duration, dose of ongoing SQ therapy (see Appendix for guidelines on adjusting therapy) and adverse events. Additional clinical contact (additional phone contacts or clinical visits) may be performed if felt clinically indicated by the study team or clinical provider. All subjects will have assessment of electrolytes and renal function by protocol 2 days post discharge. More frequent electrolyte monitoring can be performed at the discretion of the study team or clinical provider as clinically indicated. Patients receiving the SQ pump for outpatient use should be prescribed a supplementation regimen based on electrolyte supplementation needs in the hospital with IV diuretic therapy. The duration of subcutaneous therapy will be planned for 1-7 days depending on clinical response. Dose and frequency of oral diuretics once SQ therapy is completed will be per the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nUsual care strategy:\n\nSubjects randomized to usual care will continue to receive inpatient therapy, eventual transition to oral diuretics, and discharge and post discharge care as per the discretion of the treating clinician and standard treatment guidelines. In addition, they will have a Day 7 study phone call and a Day 30 study visit."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Acute Heart Failure", "Decompensated Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 11, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Subcutaneous Furosemide and sc2wear device", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects will receive device training and study materials (SQ pump device and up to a 7 day supply of SQ furosemide vials) on the day of randomization (study day 0) and discharged within 24 hours.
