This study was considered to be exploratory.\n\nUpon successful completion of screening evaluations (-10 to -5 days prior to enrollment), all eligible participants were assigned at Baseline (Day 0 visit) to an initial dose of patiromer (20 g/day) and spironolactone (25 mg/day).\n\nStudy visits for enrolled participants were scheduled for Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56. A follow-up visit occurred on Day 63.\n\nAt selected study visits, patiromer or spironolactone doses may have been titrated. The study dosing algorithm was designed to maintain an individual's serum potassium value in the range of 4.0 - 5.1 mEq/L (based on local lab data).\n\nAny participant with a local laboratory serum potassium value \\< 3.5 or \\> 5.5 mEq/L on two consecutive scheduled study visits, despite titration of patiromer or spironolactone, were withdrawn from the study, permanently discontinued patiromer and spironolactone, and returned for a follow-up visit within 7 days."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["HF", "Heart failure", "hyperkalemia", "chronic kidney disease", "prevention of hyperkalemia in heart failure participants"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 63, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "patiromer", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "spironolactone + patiromer", "interventionNames": ["Drug: patiromer", "Drug: spironolactone"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "patiromer", "description": "Active investigational drug", "armGroupLabels": ["patiromer"], "otherNames": ["RLY5016", "Veltassa"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "spironolactone", "armGroupLabels": ["patiromer"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Percentage of Participants With Serum Potassium in the Range of 3.5 - 5.5 mEq/L at the End of Treatment", "timeFrame": "56 days"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Percentage of Participants With Serum Potassium in the Range of 3.5 - 5.5 mEq/L at Week 4", "timeFrame": "28 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Participants With Serum Potassium in the Range of 3.5 - 5.5 mEq/L at Week 8", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Participants With Serum Potassium in the Range of 4.0 - 5.1 mEq/L at Week 4", "timeFrame": "28 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Participants With Serum Potassium in the Range of 4.0 - 5.1 mEq/L at Week 8", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Participants With Serum Potassium in the Range of 4.0 - 5.1 mEq/L at the End of Treatment", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Mean Dose of Patiromer at End of Treatment", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Participants Requiring Patiromer Uptitration", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Participants Requiring Patiromer Downtitration", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Median Time to First Patiromer Dose Titration", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Mean Number of Patiromer Titrations", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Mean Patiromer Dose at Week 1", "timeFrame": "Up to Week 1"}, {"measure": "Mean Patiromer Dose at Week 4", "timeFrame": "Up to Week 4"}, {"measure": "Mean Patiromer Dose at Week 8", "timeFrame": "Up to Week 8"}, {"measure": "Mean Change From Baseline in Serum Potassium to End of Treatment", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Participants Discontinuing Due to Hyperkalemia (Serum Potassium > 5.5 mEq/L)", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Percentage of Patients Whose Spironolactone Dose Was Increased Up to 50 mg/Day", "timeFrame": "56 Days"}, {"measure": "Change in Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) From Baseline to Week 4 Among Participants With ACR \u2265 30 mg/g at Baseline", "timeFrame": "Baseline and Day 28"}, {"measure": "Change in ACR From Baseline to Week 8 Among Participants With Urine ACR \u2265 30 mg/g at Baseline", "timeFrame": "Baseline and Day 56"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
