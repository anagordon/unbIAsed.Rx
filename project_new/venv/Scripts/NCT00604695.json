Efficacy will be assessed by measurements of both the angiographic characteristics of the culprit lesion as well as by measurements of epicardial flow and myocardial perfusion in the territory of the infarct-related artery. This study will also evaluate the safety of administering low-dose IC tenecteplase to subjects undergoing primary PCI for STEMI treated with standard therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors). Safety endpoints include the incidence of death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), abrupt vessel closure, subacute stent thrombosis, and TIMI major and minor bleeding events.\n\nPrompt reperfusion therapy with primary PCI in patients with STEMI improves clinical outcomes through salvage of myocardial tissue. The proposed pilot trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive low-dose IC tenecteplase in conjunction with standard medical therapy during primary PCI for STEMI. We hypothesized that low-dose IC tenecteplase will enhance fibrinolysis at the site of the culprit lesion leading to reduced microvascular dysfunction. As reduced dose tenecteplase will be injected directly into the coronary artery increasing local concentration of the drug with minor systemic effects, an improved safety profile is also expected from this mode of administration."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Acute Myocardial Infarction"], "keywords": ["ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Acute Myocardial Infarction", "No Reflow"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 40, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "1", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Two (4mg) doses of tenecteplase", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Tenecteplase"]}, {"label": "2", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Two (4mL) doses of sterile saline", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Sterile Saline"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Tenecteplase", "description": "Intracoronary injection of IV tenecteplase.", "armGroupLabels": ["1"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Sterile Saline", "description": "Intracoronary injection of IV sterile saline", "armGroupLabels": ["2"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Percent Diameter Stenosis of the Culprit Lesion Following the First Bolus of Study Drug Prior to Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "timeFrame": "Following the First Bolus of Study Drug Prior to Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Patients With Decrease in Thrombus Grade in the Culprit Artery Following the First Bolus of Study Drug Prior to Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "timeFrame": "Following the First Bolus of Study Drug Prior to Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention"}, {"measure": "Number of Patients With Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Myocardial Perfusion Grade (TMPG) of 2 or 3 in the Territory of the Culprit Artery Following Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Prior to Second Bolus of the Study Drug", "description": "Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Myocardial Perfusion Grade (TMPG) of 2 or 3 in the territory of the culprit artery", "timeFrame": "Following Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Prior to Second Bolus of the Study Drug"}, {"measure": "Measurements of Flow Velocity in the Culprit Artery in Terms of Corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Frame Count (cTFC)", "description": "Corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Frame Count (cTFC) in the culprit artery", "timeFrame": "Following Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Prior to Second Bolus of the Study Drug"}, {"measure": "Number of Patients With Hyperemic Flow in the Culprit Artery.
