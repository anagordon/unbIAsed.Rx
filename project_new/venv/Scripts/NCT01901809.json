Patients with HFPEF are often preload dependent and despite admission to the hospital for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), are typically difficult to diurese due to the development of acute kidney injury. No studies have been performed evaluating treatment strategies for these patients. The investigators hypothesize that changing the method of diuresis and/or the addition of low-dose dopamine for the treatment of ADHF in patients with HFPEF will reduce renal injury, resulting in a shorter length of stay, and decrease hospital readmissions over the ensuing year. This trial will randomize patients to either bolus or continuous infusion furosemide and then to either dopamine or no dopamine. The primary endpoint will be renal function at 72 hours as measured by change in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). Secondary endpoints for readmission, functional capacity, quality of life, and amount of diuresis will also be collected."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure, Diastolic"], "keywords": ["Heart failure, diastolic", "HFpEF", "Diuretics", "Dopamine"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "FACTORIAL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 90, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Bolus furosemide and no dopamine", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "If the patient is not on a prior diuretic dose, a standard dose of furosemide 40mg IV every 12 hrs, with total dose of 80 mg IV over 24 hrs will be initiated.\n\nIf the patient is already on a prescribed diuretic dose, their outpatient dose will be doubled and administered as the equivalent IV dose every 12 hrs.
