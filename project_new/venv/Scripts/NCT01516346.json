Secondary endpoints include left ventricular (LV) mass, fibrosis and diastolic function) and exercise capacity (assessed via the 6-minute walk test) in patients with Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFPEF). We will also test the hypothesis that the reduction in arterial wave reflections induced by vasoactive therapy will correlate with the improvement in exercise capacity, LV mass, fibrosis and diastolic function. Finally, we will assess whether the hemodynamic response to an acute dose of sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) can predict the sustained changes in the reflected wave and other hemodynamic parameters in response to chronic vasodilator therapy."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure", "Congestive Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure", "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)", "Vasodilators", "Isosorbide dinitrate", "Hydralazine", "wave reflections", "arterial stiffness", "hemodynamics"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 44, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Isosorbide dinitrate", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Research pharmacy-formulated capsules will be given to the subjects in two bottles.
