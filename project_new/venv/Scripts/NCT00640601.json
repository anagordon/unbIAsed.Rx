Admitted to hospital for treatment of DM or DM related illness in past 12 weeks.\n  * Not under care of physician responsible for patient's DM care.\n  * Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not indicated that patient's DM is controlled.\n  * Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not approved patient's participation in the study.\n  * Has not been on the same dose of oral hypoglycemic drug(s) and/or diet for the four (4) weeks prior to randomisation.
