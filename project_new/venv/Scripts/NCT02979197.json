(Kitov) is developing KIT-302, an oral fixed combination drug product (FCDP) consisting of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib, as a \"convenience reformulation\" FCDP to facilitate and improve patient compliance with the once a day (qd) administration of its individual components, amlodipine and celecoxib.\n\nThe formulation of KIT-302 consists of amlodipine besylate and celecoxib co-formulated in a single immediate release tablet. However, for this study (KIT-302-03-02), commercial celecoxib capsules (Celebrex\u00ae) and commercial amlodipine besylate tablets (Norvasc\u00ae) were separately over-encapsulated (OE) and matched placebos were used to allow for blinding.\n\nKitov completed a phase 3 pivotal trial in subjects with newly diagnosed hypertension (KIT-302-03-01) demonstrating that the amlodipine + celecoxib combination was statistically non-inferior to amlodipine monotherapy with regard to reduction of blood pressure. Further, trends towards superior blood pressure lowering effects and improved renal function were observed for the combination. This study (KIT-302-03-02) was conducted to quantify the beneficial renovascular effects noted in the prior study in subjects with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy.\n\nOn May 31, 2018, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KIT-302, under the brand name Consensi\u00ae (amlodipine and celecoxib) tablets \\[New Drug Application (NDA) 210045\\] for the following indication: \"patients for whom treatment with amlodipine for hypertension and celecoxib for osteoarthritis are appropriate. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\"", "detailedDescription": "This was a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in subjects with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy.

All drugs were to be administered orally qd for 14 days for a total of 14 doses. Visits at the clinic took place at the start and at the end of the screening phase, at Study Day 0 (start of treatment), Day 6, Day 7, Day 13 (end of treatment), Day 14 and Day 28 (end of follow-up)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Hypertension"], "keywords": ["High blood pressure", "Systolic blood pressure", "Diastolic blood pressure", "Antihypertensive"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "FACTORIAL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 105, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Amlodipine+Celecoxib", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "OE 10 mg amlodipine besylate tablet + OE 200 mg celecoxib capsule qd for 14 days", "interventionNames": ["Drug: OE 10 mg amlodipine besylate tablet", "Drug: OE 200 mg celecoxib capsule"]}, {"label": "Amlodipine+Placebo", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "OE 10 mg amlodipine besylate tablet + matched placebo for OE celecoxib capsule qd for 14 days", "interventionNames": ["Drug: OE 10 mg amlodipine besylate tablet", "Drug: Matched placebo for OE celecoxib capsule"]}, {"label": "Placebo+Placebo", "type": "SHAM_COMPARATOR", "description": "Matched placebo for OE amlodipine besylate tablet + matched placebo for OE celecoxib capsule qd for 14 days", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Matched placebo for OE amlodipine besylate tablet", "Drug: Matched placebo for OE celecoxib capsule"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "OE 10 mg amlodipine besylate tablet", "armGroupLabels": ["Amlodipine+Celecoxib", "Amlodipine+Placebo"], "otherNames": ["OE 10 mg Norvasc tablet"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "OE 200 mg celecoxib capsule", "armGroupLabels": ["Amlodipine+Celecoxib"], "otherNames": ["OE 200 mg Celebrex capsule"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Matched placebo for OE amlodipine besylate tablet", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo+Placebo"], "otherNames": ["Matched placebo for OE Norvasc tablet"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Matched placebo for OE celecoxib capsule", "armGroupLabels": ["Amlodipine+Placebo", "Placebo+Placebo"], "otherNames": ["Matched placebo for OE Celebrex capsule"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Average Daytime (9:00 to 21:00) Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (SBPday)", "description": "An ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) fitted to upper arm was used for continuous recording of blood pressure over three 25-hour periods: Days -1 to 0 (Baseline), Days 6 to 7, \\& Days 13 to 14.
