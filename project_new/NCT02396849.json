CPAP is a machine that produces airflow to help people with breathing problems. To use it, you will wear a mask connected by a hose to the CPAP machine. We believe that use of CPAP may be a treatment for children with asthma.", "detailedDescription": "During the previous funding period of this project, our laboratory demonstrated that chronic mechanical strain imposed on the airways in vivo using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) results in a dramatic reduction in airway reactivity in vivo in mice, ferrets and rabbits1-3. Lungs, airways and airway smooth muscle (ASM) tissues isolated from CPAP-treated animals studied in vitro exhibited lower responsiveness to bronchoconstrictors1-3. We also observed this suppression of airway responsiveness by chronic mechanical strain in a rabbit model of allergic asthma5. These animal studies led to a small clinical trial in which adults with asthma were treated with nocturnal CPAP for 1 week. CPAP caused a significant reduction in airway reactivity in these patients6. This novel approach for treating airway hyper-reactivity is currently being evaluated in a NIH multi-center Phase II clinical trial of adults with mild to moderate asthma (U01 HL108730)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 84, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Use of a CPAP machine for at least 5 days per week for 28 days", "interventionNames": ["Device: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)"]}, {"label": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Sham", "type": "SHAM_COMPARATOR", "description": "Use of a sham CPAP machine for at least 5 days per week for 28 days", "interventionNames": ["Device: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Sham"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)", "description": "Subjects assigned to this group will be asked to use the CPAP machine for a minimum of 4 hours/night at least 5 days/week for a total of 4 weeks.", "armGroupLabels": ["Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Sham", "description": "Subjects assigned to this group will be asked to use the CPAP Sham machine for a minimum of 4 hours/night at least 5 days/week for a total of 4 weeks.", "armGroupLabels": ["Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Sham"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Airway Reactivity From Baseline (Visit 1) and 4 Weeks (Visit 2)", "description": "The change in airway reactivity measured prior to and after 4 weeks of either CPAP or SHAM treatment.
