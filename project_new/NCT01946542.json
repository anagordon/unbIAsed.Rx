The first visit will involve completion of the informed consent process followed by a screening for study eligibility. The screening will consist of questionnaires pertaining to detailed medical history, diet, physical activity, and health-related quality of life (KCCQ). Anthropometric measures and a general health screening (including heart rate, resting blood pressure, and small blood (\\<15 mL) and urine samples will be collected). Volunteers meeting eligibility requirements will be scheduled for a screening maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. Immediately prior to the exercise treadmill test, each subject will have a resting ECG and blood pressure to determine whether there are any abnormalities that would contraindicate exercise testing. Qualified subjects will then undergo a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) test.\n\nFollowing successful completion of the screening CPX test, volunteers meeting eligibility requirements will be scheduled for two testing visits, at least one week apart. At one visit, participants will consume a small cup of beet juice concentrate, and at the other, they will consume placebo. Treatment will be double-blinded and administered in random order."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["exercise", "heart failure", "fatigue", "physical endurance", "functional food"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1", "PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 2, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "placebo drink, single dose, taste and color-matched to experimental drink", "interventionNames": ["Other: placebo"]}, {"label": "beet juice concentrate", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "single dose of beet juice concentrate, roughly 70 mL", "interventionNames": ["Drug: beet juice concentrate"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "beet juice concentrate", "description": "single dose of beet juice concentrate, roughly 70 mL", "armGroupLabels": ["beet juice concentrate"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "placebo", "armGroupLabels": ["placebo"], "otherNames": ["placebo drink, single dose, taste and color-matched to experimental drink"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Exercise Tolerance", "description": "treadmill time to exhaustion, cardiopulmonary exercise test", "timeFrame": "Testing Visit 1 (1-2 weeks from baseline) and Testing Visit 2 (2-3 weeks from baseline)"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Vascular Function", "description": "flow-mediated dilation (FMD)", "timeFrame": "Testing Visit 1 (1-2 weeks from baseline) and Testing Visit 2 (2-3 weeks from baseline)"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III heart failure\n* receiving optimal medical therapy\n* sedentary\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* smoking\n* changes in medication or major cardiovascular (CV) event or procedure within the previous 6 wk\n* fixed rate pacemaker\n* unstable angina\n* other co-morbidities or limitations that preclude safe participation in the exercise testing\n* plans for hospitalization or cardiac transplantation within the next 2 months\n* type 1 diabetes\n* refusal or inability to provide informed consent", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "55 Years", "maximumAge": "90 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"overallOfficials": [{"name": "William Kraus, MD", "affiliation": "Duke University", "role": "PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}], "locations": [{"facility": "Duke University Medical Center", "city": "Durham", "state": "North Carolina", "zip": "27710", "country": "United States", "geoPoint": {"lat": 35.99403, "lon": -78.89862}}]}, "referencesModule": {"references": [{"pmid": "21454745", "type": "BACKGROUND", "citation": "Kenjale AA, Ham KL, Stabler T, Robbins JL, Johnson JL, Vanbruggen M, Privette G, Yim E, Kraus WE, Allen JD.
