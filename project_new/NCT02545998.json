A key recommendation in the report is the provision of an annual asthma review in primary care.\n\nTelehealthcare is an alternative means of service delivery incorporating the use of telephone and e-mail consultations which may improve access and quality of patient care. There is scant data on the role of teleheathcare in asthma care.\n\nThis is a single-centre, primary care-based, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the use of telehealthcare to conduct the annual asthma review for adult patients with well-controlled asthma. This will be compared with standard care (face-to-face consultations).\n\nTelehealthcare will consist of a telephone consultation followed by an e-mail with an attached personalised asthma action plan and a link to a video demonstrating inhaler technique.\n\nStandard care will involve a face-to-face consultation in primary care. The two patient groups will be compared prospectively to determine whether there is a difference in the quality of care evaluated in terms of the patient experience/ satisfaction, health-related quality of life, asthma control and frequency of asthma exacerbations over a 6 month period after the asthma review.\n\nThe data will be presented in the form of frequency tables, bar charts and pie charts. Non-parametric tests will be applied to determine whether there is a significant difference in the quality of care received."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Telehealthcare"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 88, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Standard care", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Patients will receive a face-to-face asthma review"}, {"label": "Telehealthcare", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Patients will receive a telephone consultation and e-mail with attached PAAP and video link", "interventionNames": ["Other: Telehealthcare"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Telehealthcare", "description": "Telephone consultation plus e-mail with attached PAAP and video link", "armGroupLabels": ["Telehealthcare"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Patient Experience: Overall Patient Experience Score (General Practice Assessment Questionnaire GPAQ Score)", "description": "General Practice Assessment Questionnaire (GPAQ) is a widely used questionnaire to assess the patient experience of general practice in the UK.
