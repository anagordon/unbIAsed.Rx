The aims of this study are to 1) develop a protocol-based, promotora-led lifestyle intervention (PLI) to promote weight loss in at-risk Latinas, and assess its feasibility; 2) compare changes in weight and cardiometabolic markers-hemoglobin A1C, fasting lipids, blood pressure-from baseline to 1 year between at-risk Latinas randomly assigned to the PLI group versus metformin and usual care (UC) groups; and 3) understand the social and cultural context surrounding weight-related behaviors among Latinas at-risk for diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that Latinas assigned to PLI and metformin will have greater weight loss (primary outcome) and greater improvements in cardiometabolic markers from baseline to 1 year than those randomized to UC"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 92, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Promotora-led Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The Promotora-led Intervention consists of a core curriculum or 12 group sessions of 90 minute duration over a 12-week period and will be followed by a maintenance phase of 10 biweekly and then monthly 90-minute sessions during months 4 through 12.
