However, little is known about RV pacing in patients with advanced heart failure treated with an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The univentricular support provided by contemporary continuous flow LVAD's has improved outcomes for many advanced heart failure patients, yet the incidence of RV failure in the early post-operative period following implantation is associated with significantly reduced survival and increased length of stay. Acute LVAD unloading of the left ventricle has adverse effects on RV shape and size that contribute to post-operative RV failure. By promoting RV synchrony, RV overdrive pacing may counteract these adverse mechanical alterations, improving RV systolic function and ultimately LVAD function.\n\nThe investigators will recruit all patients referred for an implantable, continuous flow LVAD at Duke University Medical Center who have an existing implantable dual-chamber cardioverter-defibrillator. Patients will be prospectively randomized into two cohorts to compare continuous right ventricular pacing vs. native ventricular conduction at equivalent heart rates. Multiple clinical outcomes will be examined over a two week period post-operatively including invasive hemodynamics, vasoactive medication use, end-organ function, RV function by Echocardiography as well as patient symptoms and functional status."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Ventricular assist device"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 3, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Native Conduction", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Devices will be programmed to continuous atrial pacing at an AAI (atrial inhibited pacing) setting with base rate 90 bpm.
