Approximately 40 clinical sites in the United States will randomize 316 subjects. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two double-blind treatments using a 1:1 randomization. Subjects will be identified for their eligibility for enrolment starting in April 2010. Eligible subjects will be invited to return for randomization into the study in August 2010. This exploratory study is being conducted to assess whether treatment with ADVAIR\u2122 DISKUS\u2122 100/50 mcg is more effective at reducing the risk of exacerbation and the asthma impairment associated with viral respiratory tract infections during the fall season when compared to treatment with FLOVENT\u2122 DISKUS\u2122 100 mcg.", "detailedDescription": "Study ADA113872 will assess the ability of ADVAIR\u2122 DISKUS\u2122 100/50 mcg, in comparison to FLOVENT\u2122 DISKUS\u2122 100 mcg, to reduce worsening asthma associated with viral respiratory infections during the fall season in a pediatric population. A number of descriptive measures will be used to assess the reduction in worsening asthma. These include the number of exacerbations, the duration and severity of asthma symptoms in the 7 days following the report of moderate upper respiratory tract symptoms or worsening asthma, the number of rescue-free days, and the rate of asthma control days.\n\nSubjects will be identified starting in April 2010 to evaluate whether they meet the eligibility criteria. If a subject is identified as a potential candidate for the study they will be requested to return to the clinic between August 2, 2010 and August 20, 2010. Subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. All subjects must be randomized on or before August 20th, 2010.\n\nSubjects will be males and females who are between the ages of 4 and 11 years (as of randomization date) with a documented diagnosis of asthma requiring ICS monotherapy controller medication or low dose ICS as part of combination controller medication. In order for a subject on moderate dose ICS or low dose ICS + LABA combination therapy to be eligible for inclusion in this study their asthma must be under control for the 3 months prior to randomization and they must be a candidate for step-down therapy as outlined by current asthma management guidelines.\n\nAll subjects must have a history of one or more exacerbations during the previous respiratory viral season that required the use of outpatient oral/parenteral corticosteroid or an urgent care, Emergency Department visit hospitalization, or for asthma that required the use of oral/parenteral corticosteroid.\n\nSubjects will receive their study medication at the Randomization visit and be instructed to keep an electronic daily record of AM PEF, asthma symptoms, night-time awakenings due to asthma, rescue use, and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.\n\nDuring the double-blind treatment period the electronic Diary (eDiary) will alert the subject or parent/legal guardian when the data imputed into the eDiary indicates the presence of upper respiratory symptoms of moderate or severe severity or if the subject has reached the criteria for worsening asthma. Upon receipt of either of these alerts, the subject or parent/legal guardian will be instructed to call the clinic. The clinic will instruct the subject (parent/legal guardian) to provide a mucus sample for assessment of viral respiratory infection. Mucus samples for viral respiratory assessment will not be collected from subjects more than once in a 7 day period. During the randomization visit subjects will receive training on the at home collection of a mucus sample.\n\nThroughout the study each subject will be instructed to rate their daily upper respiratory symptoms. Upper respiratory tract symptoms include: runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and sore throat. Subjects will be instructed to select a rating from the following list that best describes their aggregate upper respiratory symptoms during the previous 24 hours.\n\nThis study will evaluate the effects of the ADVAIR\u2122 DISKUS\u2122 100/50 mcg and FLOVENT\u2122 DISKUS\u2122 100 mcg on clinical parameters and indices of airway inflammation associated with viral respiratory tract infections in pediatric asthmatic subjects.
