Only patients from the Ankara area of Hacettepe University Medical Center in Turkey will be included in this study.", "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND:\n\nAsthma has a large impact on the children of our society. It is among the most common chronic diseases of childhood and is the leading cause of absenteeism from school. It is unknown as to why more children are having recurrent episodes of wheezing and why some children have asthma while others do not. There is increasing evidence that differences in innate immune responses among children can determine which child will have recurrent wheezing and asthma. While many studies have focused on the factors that initiate innate immune responses, there are relatively few studies of the downstream factors that cause abnormal airway responses. There is evidence that eicosanoid mediators are part of the innate immune response and can function as its effector arm for allergic responses. The ability of leukotrienes and prostaglandins to produce central features of the asthma phenotype is well described and there is emerging evidence that lipoxins facilitate restoration of allergic changes in the airways. This study will test the hypothesis that the balance of airway eicosanoid expression during early-life wheezing illness and the genetically determined capacity to respond will predict recurrent wheezing. Moreover, an intervention to restore a more normal tissue response to this imbalance will reduce symptoms of early-life wheezing and subsequent recurrent episodes.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nThis will be a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the effects of montelukast on the duration of wheezing in children 12 months to 3 years of age who are under the care of a physician for a wheezing illness. Study treatment will be given for 56 days. Participants who are 2 to 3 years old will receive either 5-mg montelukast tablets or matching placebo. Participants who are 12 months to 2 years old will receive 4-mg montelukast granules or matching placebo. The primary outcome parameter of this study will be the number of days that the infant is observed to be free of wheezing by the primary caregiver. The secondary outcome parameters will be the number of wheezing episodes during the treatment period and the rate of recurrent wheezing during the follow-up period. The study, which is a consortium arrangement between the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Hacettepe University Medical Center in Turkey, will recruit children only from the Ankara area of Hacettepe University Medical Center in Turkey.\n\nThis study will be one of three, which include: 1) measuring the airway eicosanoid profiles of pediatric \"wheezing\" patients 3 months to 3 years old; 2) determining if genetic variants in eicosanoid metabolic and response pathways are associated with recurrent wheezing; and 3) determining how intervention with montelukast (singulair) affects symptoms and the rate of recurrent wheezing."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Lung Diseases", "Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2", "PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 62, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Montelukast", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants who are 2 to 3 years old received 5-mg montelukast tablets and participants who are 12 months to 2 years old received 4-mg montelukast granules.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Montelukast"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Participants who are 2 to 3 years old received 5-mg montelukast placebo tablets and participants who are 12 months to 2 years old received 4-mg montelukast placebo granules.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Montelukast", "description": "Participants who are 2 to 3 years old received 5-mg montelukast tablets and participants who are 12 months to 2 years old received 4-mg montelukast granules.", "armGroupLabels": ["Montelukast"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Participants who were 2 to 3 years old received placebo montelukast tablets and participants who were 12 months to 2 years old received placebo montelukast granules.", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Wheezing-free Days of Infant (Observed by Primary Caregiver)", "timeFrame": "First 56 days of study"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Wheezing at Day 7", "timeFrame": "Study day 7"}, {"measure": "The Number of Participants Requiring Rescue Beta Agonist Use", "timeFrame": "Measured during the daytime"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Physician-diagnosed wheezing illness\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Asthma\n* Prematurity\n* Known intolerance to montelukast", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "3 Months", "maximumAge": "3 Years", "stdAges": ["CHILD"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"overallOfficials": [{"name": "Craig M.
