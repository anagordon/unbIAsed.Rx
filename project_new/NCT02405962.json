Parents, as the primary caregivers, experience different level of psychological distress in taking care of their children with asthma. Some of them responded with avoidance-based coping, which results in poor asthma symptom management and monitoring. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a contextual focused, behavioral therapy aiming at improving psychological flexibility, so that a person can be more opened up to engaging in value-driven behavior modification, thus attaining an optimal disease control. The benefits of ACT have been demonstrated on both parents and their children with chronic health conditions such as developmental disabilities, acquired brain injuries, chronic pain, cancer and mental disorders. To date, no ACT intervention has been conducted on examining its effects on training parents in managing their children with asthmatic conditions.\n\nThis is the first study aims to examine the effects of a parental training program using group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in reducing the unplanned health care services utilization and asthmatic symptoms, among children with asthma. Parents of children diagnosed with asthma will either receive one session of pediatric asthma educational talk as usual practice in the study hospital, or in addition, four sessions of group-based ACT integrated with asthma education.\n\nIf the group-based ACT is effective in reducing children's asthmatic symptoms and overall unplanned asthma-related health services utilization, it could lead to substantial health benefits in children with asthma and on parents with a reduction in psychological distress. In addition to cutting medical expenses, it could also contribute to the community health through the reduction in mortality and morbidity due to asthmatic attacks. Furthermore, information collected from this proposed study will open up an opportunity for exploring the potential of ACT-based intervention in managing other childhood chronic diseases."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Childhood Asthma"], "keywords": ["Acceptance and Commitment Therapy", "Childhood asthma", "Randomized controlled trial", "Training parents"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 168, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Control group", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Parents of children with asthma will receive one session of asthma educational talk as the usual care, plus three weekly sessions of telephone calls to assess the child's asthma symptoms", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Control"]}, {"label": "ACT group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Parents of children with asthma will receive four sessions of group-based ACT intervention integrated with asthma education (its content will be the same as that of the Control Group).", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: ACT"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "ACT", "description": "Four sessions of group-based ACT integrated with asthma education.
