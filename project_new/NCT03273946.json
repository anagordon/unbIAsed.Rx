The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and predictors of these adverse reactions among subjects will be reported. This single arm observational study will include subjects prescribed with FP 50 \u00b5g inhaled via a pediatric spacer device with a face mask. The maximum duration of the study will be 12 weeks with 3 visits. Visit 1 (Day 1) will be on-site visit and will also mark the start of the observational program. The follow-up visits will be scheduled at Visit 2 (Week 4), and Visit 3 (Week 12) conducted on site or by telephone.
