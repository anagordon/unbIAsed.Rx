Treatment with inhaled Fluticasone furoate and Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol are included as an active control.\n\nDetailed Description: Long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (anti-cholinergic bronhcodilator) exert their effects via distinct and complementary bronchodilator mechanisms on large and small airways. Most of the experience with older anti-cholinergics had been with acute use and little is known about their effect in chronic use in asthma. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate 5 doses of inhaled GSK573719 inhaled over 14 days in patients with asthma. Fluticasone furoate (100 mcg) and Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol (100/59mcg) will be included as an active comparator. Each eligible subject will receive a sequence of 3 of 7 potential treatments for a total of 3 treatment periods per subject. The total duration of subject participation is approximately 14 weeks."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Fluticasone Furoate", "Vilanterol", "Adults", "GSK573719", "Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 421, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Fluticasone Furoate (FF)", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "100mcg, inhaled", "interventionNames": ["Drug: FF"]}, {"label": "Fluticasone Furoate /Vilanterol (VI)", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "100/25mcg inhaled", "interventionNames": ["Drug: FF/VI"]}, {"label": "Fluticasone Furoate/GSK573719", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "100/15.6-250mcg inhaled", "interventionNames": ["Drug: FF/GSK573719"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF/GSK573719", "description": "100/15.6", "armGroupLabels": ["Fluticasone Furoate/GSK573719"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF/GSK573719", "description": "100/31.25", "armGroupLabels": ["Fluticasone Furoate/GSK573719"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF/GSK573719", "description": "100/62.5", "armGroupLabels": ["Fluticasone Furoate/GSK573719"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF/GSK573719", "description": "100/125", "armGroupLabels": ["Fluticasone Furoate/GSK573719"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF/GSK573719", "description": "100/250", "armGroupLabels": ["Fluticasone Furoate/GSK573719"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF", "description": "100", "armGroupLabels": ["Fluticasone Furoate (FF)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "FF/VI", "description": "100/25", "armGroupLabels": ["Fluticasone Furoate /Vilanterol (VI)"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Model Predicted Change From Baseline Trough Force Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)", "description": "FEV1 is a lung function measure defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second.
