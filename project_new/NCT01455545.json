Measurement of asthma control with Asthma Control Test (ACT)will be performed. Then fraction exhaled of nitric oxide (FeNO)measurement and pulmonary function testing (forced spirometry and bronchodilator test) will be performed .\n\nDEVICES AND MEASUREMENTS: Clinical variables will be collected in a case report form (CRF) specially developed for the study. Functional study: The spirometry will be performed according to the recommendations of European Respiratory Society using the Jaeger Master Lab system.\n\nBronchodilator test will be performed with albuterol and ipratropium bromide inhalation solution. FeNO levels will be measured of using the Filt's Vario analyzer which allows for bronchial or nasal tests, with a flow and volume meter Lilly-type pneumotachograph .
