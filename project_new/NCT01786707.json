Then they will be randomized into either the intervention group or the control group:", "detailedDescription": "This is a phase I/II, prospective, randomized case controlled study in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) that seeks to investigate whether the combination of intrapancreatic Autologous Stem Cell infusion (ASC) and Hyperbaric Oxygen treatment (HBO) can improve glycemic control and pancreatic function in T2DM patients compared to controls receiving standard medical treatment (SMT) with metformin and insulin alone.\n\nNew therapies that lead to stopping \u00df-cell damage and possible \u00df-cell regeneration may decrease the incidence and progression of T2DM chronic complications and together with achievable life style changes may improve general health and quality of life of T2DM patients. Preliminary data from a pilot study involving 25 subjects with T2DM that underwent a combined treatment using ASC+HBO showed a significant progressive and consistent reduction in plasma glucose and HbA1c with an increase in C-peptide in conjunction with a decrease in the number and dose of oral agents and/or insulin. These encouraging preliminary results require confirmation in a controlled, randomized prospective trial."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"], "keywords": ["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT)", "Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Buffy Coat", "Stem cells (SC)"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1", "PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 2, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Autologous SC and HOT", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Autologous stem cells and hyperbaric oxygen therapy", "interventionNames": ["Biological: Autologous stem cells", "Other: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy", "Drug: Insulin", "Drug: Metformin"]}, {"label": "Control group", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Patients in a control group will continue with standard medical treatment (Insulin and Metformin)", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Insulin", "Drug: Metformin"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "Autologous stem cells", "description": "Pancreatic artery infusion of Autologous Stem cells.", "armGroupLabels": ["Autologous SC and HOT"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy", "armGroupLabels": ["Autologous SC and HOT"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Insulin", "description": "Insulin dose as per clinical management", "armGroupLabels": ["Autologous SC and HOT", "Control group"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Metformin", "description": "Metformin dose as tolerated", "armGroupLabels": ["Autologous SC and HOT", "Control group"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Participants With a Reduction of HbA1c of >0.5%", "timeFrame": "1 year"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "The Number of Subjects With a Reduction of >1% in HbA1c", "timeFrame": "at 1 year"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
