The study will enroll male and female outpatients (\u2265 18 years of age) with partial-onset seizures (POS) who are inadequately controlled on their current monotherapy Antiepileptic Drug (AED). Following a Screening Period of up to 2 weeks, subjects will enter an 8-week Baseline Phase to determine baseline seizure frequency. At the end of the Baseline Phase, subjects who meet or exceed the minimum seizure frequency of 4 partial seizures per 56 days, will enter the Treatment Period (4 weeks Titration, 16 weeks Flexible Dose Evaluation Phase). All subjects will receive retigabine IR starting at 150 mg/day and will be titrated to 600 mg/day by Week 4. From Week 5 onwards, subjects' doses will be maintained between 300 to 1200 mg/day using a flexible dosing regimen to optimise response and tolerability. The maximum duration of the study is approximately 33 weeks (inclusive of a 3 week Taper/Follow-up Phase)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Epilepsy"], "keywords": ["Seizures", "retigabine IR", "GW582892", "Epilepsy", "Open label, flexible dose", "Partial-onset seizures"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 203, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Retigabine IR", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Open Label flexible dose between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Retigabine IR"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Retigabine IR", "description": "Flexible dose between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).", "armGroupLabels": ["Retigabine IR"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Participants With a >=50% Reduction in Partial-onset Seizure (POS) Frequency From Baseline", "description": "The number of participants experiencing a \\>=50% reduction from Baseline (BL) in POS frequency during the Treatment Phase (TP) (i.e., Titration Phase and Flexible Dose Evaluation \\[FDE\\] Phase) was measured.
