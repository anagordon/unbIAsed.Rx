CRT requires a pacemaker with 2 wires, one placed inside the right heart chamber and one normally placed on the outside of the left heart chamber. These two wires act together to re-time the coordination of the heartbeat, which is known to improve heart function.\n\nThe investigators are assessing whether they might be able to improve heart function even more by placing two wires on the inside of the left heart chamber, rather than one around the outside.\n\nThe investigators wish to assess whether:\n\n1. Using two wires within the left side of the heart gives a greater increase in heart function than one.\n2. It is possible to choose the best spot inside of the heart by measuring the pattern of the heart beat.\n3. Is it possible to use a different type of heart monitor placed outside the body instead of a monitor wire inside the heart to assess improvement in heart function? They are investigating this in people with hearts that beat less effectively than normal."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Ventricular Tachycardia", "Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Endocardial pacing", "Multi site pacing"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "BASIC_SCIENCE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 15, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Participants", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Having an ablation procedure with access to the left side of the heart", "interventionNames": ["Procedure: Atrial Fibrillation/flutter (AF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) ablation with multi-site pacing protocol"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "Atrial Fibrillation/flutter (AF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) ablation with multi-site pacing protocol", "description": "Pacing at several endocardial sites in isolation and individually will be performed, with response to this assessed by LV dp/dt max", "armGroupLabels": ["Participants"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Acute Haemodynamic Response to Dual Left Ventricular Pacing", "description": "Acute haemodynamic response to pacing (change in Left Ventricular dP/dt max) between dual site Left Ventricular pacing and biventricular pacing Pacing protocols were performed with a baseline of 30 seconds of right ventricular pacing followed by two 30-second test configurations, and then a further baseline.
