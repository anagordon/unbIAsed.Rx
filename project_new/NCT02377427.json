The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

Part B: It is a long-term safety / pharmacodynamic phase in which extended treatment for a further 52 weeks will be offered on an optional basis to those subjects eligible for continued treatment. Participants with bodyweight \\<40 kilogram (kg) will be dosed with mepolizumab 40 mg and participants with body weight \\>=40 kg will be dosed with mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously in upper arm or thigh at Visit 2 (Week 0). Approximately 40 male or female participants aged 6 to 11 years will be screened to achieve approximately 28 eligible participants entering the treatment phase to allow availability of 20 evaluable participants, with a minimum of six participants enrolled in the \\<40 kg bodyweight group. The total duration of the study will be 22 weeks and will include a run-in period of 1-2 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up phase of 8 weeks.
