LVAD echo guided optimization (EO) determines a more favorable hemodynamic profile and could provide an improvement on functional capacity (FC). VAFRACT is a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the additional benefit of an EO approach on FC, measured by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), in LVAD optimization free population.", "detailedDescription": "The use of Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) is a viable therapeutic option to improve survival and quality of life of patients with advanced and refractory heart failure (HF). However, after the implantation of an LVAD, patients' functional capacity (FC) is still reduced with maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) values calculated at the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) ranging from 11 to 20 ml/kg/min. LVAD echo guided optimization (EO) determines a more favorable hemodynamic profile, in particular for the right ventricle, and could provide an improvement on FC. VAFRACT is a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the additional benefit of an EO approach on FC, measured by CPET in LVAD optimization free population.\n\nThe optimal device speed is defined as the one that allows an intermittent aortic valve opening and a neutral position of the interventricular septum without increasing aortic or tricuspid regurgitation associated or not to a dilatation of the right ventricle (RV). In this condition it is reasonable to expect a more favorable hemodynamic profile for the RV and a better response in terms of functional capacity.\n\nSubjects studied are HF patients supported with a continuous-flow LVAD: HeartMate II (Thoratec Inc., Pleasanton, CA) and HeartMate 3 (HM 3, Abbott, North Chicago, IL).
