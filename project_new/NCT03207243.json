This is a phase 2a study which aims to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in subjects with moderately severe asthma. The study will be conducted in 4 phases including screening, run-in phase, treatment phase and follow-up. In treatment phase, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either GSK3772847 or placebo administered via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. During the treatment phase, the background therapy will be switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP will be reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. The total duration of study will be approximately 33 weeks and approximately 165 subjects with moderately severe asthma who are maintained on high-dose of inhaled corticosteroids/ Long-Acting Beta-2-Agonists (ICS/LABA) will be randomized."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Severe asthma", "Safety", "GSK3772847", "Efficacy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "This will be a parallel intervention model in which GSK3772847 and placebo will be administered in parallel manner to randomized subjects.", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "maskingDescription": "This is a double blind study and subjects and investigator will be masked.", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 165, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Subjects receiving GSK3772847", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Eligible subjects will receive GSK3772847 once every 4 weeks via IV route along with 500/50 mcg FP/Sal twice daily for first 2 weeks and dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: GSK3772847", "Drug: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol", "Drug: Fluticasone propionate"]}, {"label": "Subjects receiving placebo drug", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Eligible subjects will receive placebo once every 4 weeks via IV route along with 500/50 mcg FP/Sal twice daily for first 2 weeks and dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo", "Drug: Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol", "Drug: Fluticasone propionate"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "GSK3772847", "description": "GSK3772847 10 mg/kg will be administered as IV infusion once every 4 weeks to randomized subjects.", "armGroupLabels": ["Subjects receiving GSK3772847"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Placebo sterile normal saline will be administered as IV infusion once every 4 weeks to randomized subjects.", "armGroupLabels": ["Subjects receiving placebo drug"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol", "description": "FP/Sal 500/50 mcg will be administered via inhalation route twice daily to all subjects.", "armGroupLabels": ["Subjects receiving GSK3772847", "Subjects receiving placebo drug"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Fluticasone propionate", "description": "FP 500, 250, 100 or 50 mcg will be administered via inhalation route twice daily to all subjects.", "armGroupLabels": ["Subjects receiving GSK3772847", "Subjects receiving placebo drug"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Percentage of Participants With Loss of Asthma Control Over Weeks 0-16", "description": "Loss of asthma control is defined as: Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) score increase from Baseline \\>=0.5 point or pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decrease from baseline \\>7.5 % or inability to titrate inhaled corticosteroid or a clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring oral corticosteroid \\[OCS\\] and/or hospitalization).
