In the US, impoverished children and children from minority ethnic and racial backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma. While National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines recommend daily preventive medications for all children with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma, studies indicate that many children in the US who should receive preventive medications are not receiving them. The overall goal of this project is to target an ethnically diverse population of inner-city schoolchildren with asthma and explore a school-based program to reduce asthma morbidity. We hypothesize that children receiving a comprehensive school-based intervention will experience less asthma-related morbidity compared to children receiving usual care. Our comprehensive school-based intervention consists of both administration of recommended preventive asthma medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines) and an environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) reduction program in the home for smoke-exposed children. Our secondary hypothesis is that, among the subgroup of smoke-exposed children, those who receive the school-based intervention with ETS reduction will experience less asthma morbidity than those who receive usual care."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 530, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Usual Care", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Usual asthma care"}, {"label": "School-based Care", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The intervention includes directly observed administration of preventive medications in school and a home-based ETS reduction program (for those living with one or more smokers).", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: School-based Care"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "School-based Care", "description": "The intervention includes directly observed administration of preventive medications in school and a home-based ETS reduction program (for those living with one or more smokers).", "armGroupLabels": ["School-based Care"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Symptom Free Days", "description": "The primary outcome variable is the average number of symptom free days over 2 weeks assessed during peak asthma season (data collected during November, December, January and February during the school year).", "timeFrame": "Average Symptom Free Days, over 2 weeks, during peak asthma season (November-February)"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Cotinine Level", "description": "To test the effectiveness of the environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) reduction portion of the study, we will compare baseline cotinine values to 2 month (for smoke exposed participants) and final follow-up assessments (for all participants).", "timeFrame": "2 month and approximately 9 month (end of school year) follow-up assessments"}, {"measure": "Cost Effectiveness of the Intervention", "description": "Cost-effectiveness will examine the net program costs to the number of symptom-free days gained.
