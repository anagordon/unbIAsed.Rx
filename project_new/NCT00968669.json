The 6-item ACQ is a participant-reported questionnaire assessing asthma symptoms (night-time waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing) and daily rescue bronchodilator use. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week. Questions were weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of \u2264 0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and \\< 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score \u2265 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma.
