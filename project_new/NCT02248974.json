Regret is measured at a point in time when the respondent can reflect on the effects of the decision. Items 2 and 4 should be reverse coded so that, for each item, a higher number will indicate more regret. To help others interpret the score more readily with other scales ranging from 0 to 100, these scores can then be converted to a 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from each item then multiply by 25. To obtain a final score, the items are summed and averaged. A score of 0 means no regret; a score of 100 means high regret.", "populationDescription": "Analysis only includes participants who responded to measure at 1-Month Follow-Up (DA=26, no-DA=31, Total=67).", "reportingStatus": "POSTED", "paramType": "MEAN", "dispersionType": "Standard Deviation", "unitOfMeasure": "units on a scale", "timeFrame": "1 Month Follow-up", "groups": [{"id": "OG000", "title": "LVAD Decision Aid", "description": "Decision aid presented to subjects was developed from patient and clinician feedback to increase patient knowledge on the risks, benefits, misconceptions or mispredictions regarding LVADs to help patients make an informed decision on accepting or declining LVAD placement.\n\nLVAD Decision Aid: Decision aids are interventions or tools designed to facilitate shared decision making and patient participation in health care decisions.\n\nThis Decision Aid was designed to discuss treatment options for patients in end-stage heart failure (i.e LVAD PLACEMENT, PALLIATIVE and SUPPORTIVE CARE)."}, {"id": "OG001", "title": "No LVAD Decision Aid", "description": "The standard education process is institution-specific and unstandardized.
