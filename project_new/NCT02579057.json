Half of the patients will receive a subcutaneously administered Furosemide Injection Solution; the other half will receive an intravenous administration of Furosemide Injection.", "detailedDescription": "The prevalence of chronic heart failure is increasing, and despite advances in the treatment of chronic heart failure, in-hospital mortality and readmission are high. Heart failure costs the US about 32 billion per year, and a large percentage of the costs are due to hospitalizations. Most clinicians would agree that patients with decompensated heart failure presenting with hypotension, worsening renal function and altered mental status should be hospitalized. However, there is a subset of patients presenting with dyspnea and edema due to volume overload that necessitate rapid symptom improvement but are hemodynamically stable. Oral diuretics would likely be ineffective but hospital admission for IV diuretics seems excessive.\n\nThe research hypothesis is that subcutaneously administered furosemide will be an effective alternative to IV furosemide for hemodynamically stable chronic heart failure patients presenting with volume overload in the ambulatory setting. Patients will be randomized to receive Furosemide Injection, USP intravenously or Furosemide Injection Solution (SCP-101) delivered subcutaneously. The IV patients will get the usual care of the heart failure clinic, which includes having an IV placed and delivery of a one-time dose of IV furosemide with the dose determined by the providers (maximum dose 160mg IV). The subcutaneous patients will receive 80mg of Furosemide Injection Solution (SCP-101) administered subcutaneously over 5 hours (30mg in first hour and 12.5mg/hour for 4 hours).\n\nBoth groups of patients will be observed for 6 hours to assess diuresis. Patients will be asked to fill out a survey about their symptom improvement (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire) and overall satisfaction related to the treatment experience. They will also be monitored for side effects including ototoxicity and discomfort at the access site (burning, itching, and pain). Electrolytes and renal function will be checked once after the patients receive diuretic therapy."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Congestive Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Congestive heart failure", "Furosemide"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2", "PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 40, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Furosemide Injection Solution, USP", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Single dose determined by Investigator (maximum dose 160mg) administered intravenously by IV bolus over approximately 2 minutes (reference treatment)", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Furosemide Injection Solution, USP"]}, {"label": "Furosemide Injection Solution (SCP-101)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "80 mg dose administered subcutaneously as 30 mg over the first hour and then as 12.5 mg per hour over the subsequent 4 hours (test treatment)", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Furosemide Injection Solution (SCP-101)"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Furosemide Injection Solution (SCP-101)", "armGroupLabels": ["Furosemide Injection Solution (SCP-101)"], "otherNames": ["sc Furosemide"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Furosemide Injection Solution, USP", "armGroupLabels": ["Furosemide Injection Solution, USP"], "otherNames": ["IV furosemide"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Urine Output", "description": "The volume of urine produced in milliliters over the 6 hours after drug delivery will be measured.", "timeFrame": "6-hour period"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Heart Failure Symptom Scoring/Symptom Improvement", "description": "Will evaluate if subjective heart failure symptoms improve over the period of diuresis.
