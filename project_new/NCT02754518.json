Furthermore, Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and the heart to mediastinum ratio will be used to assess Left Ventricle (LV) volume regression and risk reduction. The investigators also intend to measure the effects of valsartan/sacubitril on exercise capacity as assessed by the 6 minute walk test and peak Volume of Oxygen (V02) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Additionally, the investigators will examine the impact of valsartan/sacubitril on functional status and quality of life using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Qualia Health (a novel iPhone application that incorporates Fitbit technology to provide a \"real time\" daily 6 minute step count and assesses quality of life using a series of short targeted questions.
