After a one-week run in, for the first 3 months subjects will use an inhaler with either albuterol or a dummy drug at regular times four times a day. Then for the last nine months of the study, all subjects will be given the albuterol dry powder inhaler and will use it only when needed to help with breathing problems. Subjects will need to keep a daily diary (both paper and electronic) throughout the study recording any inhaler use and health problems. There will be visits to the study doctor about once a month for a year. This study is intended to show that the albuterol dry powder inhaler works well and is safe for use over a long period of time.", "detailedDescription": "The Sponsor terminated this study due to the need for a modification to the Spiromax device utilized in this study; the problem identified has no impact on patient safety.
