With the use of a novel method to improve adherence and subsequently reduce morbidity, the investigators hypothesize that this novel adaptation of school-based asthma care will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school and community stakeholders, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). The investigators anticipate that enhancing preventive healthcare for young urban children with asthma through partnerships with the schools using a novel technology will yield improved health, prevention of suffering, decreased absenteeism from school, and reduced healthcare costs."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 99, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "School-Based Medication Group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "For children assigned to the School-Based Medication group, an asthma coordinator will send the child's primary care physician a report indicating the child's asthma symptoms, and will recommend that the child receive a preventive asthma medication at school.
