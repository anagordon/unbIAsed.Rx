This study has been designed to assess the correct use and ease of use of the ELLIPTA\u00ae DPI in pediatric subjects with asthma. ELLIPTA DPI is easy to use, requires few steps, is consistent in dosing and eliminates the hand-breath co-ordination required for metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Subjects will be stratified by age into two strata: Stratum 1: subjects in the age group of 5 to 7 years and Stratum 2: Subjects in the age group of 8 to 11 years. All subjects will be trained by Health care professionals (HCP) for the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI. Subjects will be given three chances to attempt correct use of ELLIPTA DPI; subsequently, if the subject is not successful, the parent/guardian will be able to help instruct the subject on the correct use of the ELLIPTA DPI, for two more attempts. The subjects who will be enrolled in the study will take placebo ELLIPTA DPI once daily. After 28 days subjects will be randomized in 1:1 to receive a questionnaire (Version A and B). After completion of the questionnaire on ELLIPTA DPI ease of use, subject's ability to use ELLIPTA DPI correctly will be re-assessed. Approximately 219 subjects will be screened to participate in the study. The study will be conducted for 28 days.
