Several potential mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in HF patients, including, but not limited to, antiarrhythmic, and hemodynamic actions. The current investigation was therefore designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with n-3 PUFAs improves LV systolic function expressed as EF in patients with stable chronic HF secondary to a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NICM). Additionally, we sought to determine if n-3 PUFAs also exert positive effects on LV diastolic function assessed by echocardiography; functional capacity assessed by cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPET); and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dilated Cardiomyopathy", "Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["n-3 PUFAs", "Heart Failure", "Dilated cardiomyopathy", "Ejection Fraction", "Exercise Capacity"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 133, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "n-3 PUFAs", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: n-3 PUFAs"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "n-3 PUFAs", "description": "1.0 g gelatin capsules containing 850 to 882 mg of EPA and DHA ethyl esters in the average ratio EPA/DHA of 0.9:1.5 The treatment dose was five capsules daily for the first month followed by two capsules daily for the rest of the study.", "armGroupLabels": ["n-3 PUFAs"], "otherNames": ["OMACOR, Pronova Biopharma, Lysaker, Norway"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "1.0 g gelatin capsules containing olive oil.
