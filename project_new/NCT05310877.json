Medication non-adherence represents a modifiable contributor to costly hospital readmissions in older adults with HF. Educational interventions improve, but do not eliminate, non-adherence. Values affirmation interventions which invite individuals to reflect on core values may encourage better engagement in health behaviors by increasing the personal relevance of targeted behaviors. Similar interventions have promoted weight loss, increased adherence and physical activity, and more frequent fruit and vegetable consumption in a variety of contexts and populations. This study seeks to test a recently developed values-affirmation intervention targeting medication adherence in older adults with HF enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The purpose of this feasibility study is to test methodology to aid development of a subsequent randomized controlled pilot trial to examine preliminary efficacy.", "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to examine the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of study procedures and the values-affirmation intervention in a single-arm trial. Participants will be asked to complete a brief intervention with tailored education relevant to medication information, motivation, and behavioral skills. Participants will complete a baseline assessment and a follow-up assessment at one month post-intervention. The investigators hypothesize that the developed study and intervention procedures will be feasible and acceptable to participants. The investigators will also examine changes in self-reported and electronically monitored medication adherence from the baseline assessment to follow-up."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "OTHER", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 7, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Values-affirmation", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Values-Affirmation"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Values-Affirmation", "description": "Participants will engage in a brief values-affirmation exercise to target personal motivation and openness to medication adherence.
