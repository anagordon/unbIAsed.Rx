CoSeal\u2122 is an FDA approved synthetic (man-made) surgical sealant which is currently used to help stop leaks in blood vessels during surgery.\n\nThis study is evaluating CoSeal\u2122 when it is applied to various areas of the heart during the surgery to implant a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD). the investigators are looking for evidence which indicates that CoSeal\u2122 may be useful in reducing or stopping bleeding, the occurrence of micro emboli (small particles of air or blood), and the formation of cardiac adhesions (scar tissue strands that may form around the heart in the area of a previous LVAD operation) in patients who undergo LVAD implantation surgery.", "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, single-blind (subjects and surgeon evaluator are blinded), randomized, multi-center, pilot study which is designed to evaluate the effects of CoSeal\u2122 when used during a surgical procedure to implant a LVAD. The study sample size is 30 subjects; subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion, 20 subjects will be randomized to CoSeal\u2122 in the Treatment Group and 10 subjects will be randomized to no sealant in the Control Group. Bioglue will be used in the control group, only if necessary.\n\nThe Primary Objective of this prospective pilot study is to evaluate the use of CoSeal\u2122 for its ability to reduce bleeding following the implantation of a LVAD. The secondary objectives will evaluate the use of CoSeal for its ability to reduce micro emboli during the LVAD implant procedure and prevent tissue adhesions following the implantation of a LVAD.\n\nCoSeal\u2122 (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill., USA) is a synthetic hydrogel consisting of two solutions of high molecular weight of polyethylene glycol which are co-extruded with a liquid sodium phosphate buffer from a syringe housing unit. The device is approved by the FDA for use in vascular reconstructions to achieve adjunctive hemostasis by mechanically sealing areas of leakage and it has been shown to provide superior anastomatic suture line sealing. In 2005, the CoSeal\u2122 medical device was also approved in Europe and Australia for use in patients undergoing cardiac surgery to prevent or reduce the incidence, severity, and extent of post-surgical adhesions.\n\nData from this study will not be used to support any labeling changes.
