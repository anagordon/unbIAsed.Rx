No changes have occurred in the patient's health or status relative to the original inclusion and exclusion criteria and the patient continues to be eligible for participation in the study.\n2. Either (i) develops subjective symptoms of asthma (wheezing, shortness of breath, cough) for which the patient would normally self-medicate with a short acting beta agonist, and/or (ii) documents a drop of 20% from screening PEF scores as recorded in their patient diary.\n3.

The patient self-administered a short-acting beta agonist within 6 hours prior to onset of asthma symptoms.\n2. The patient induced an asthma exacerbation by withholding their pre-treatment medication used for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).\n3. Has signs and symptoms of asthma instability at Visit 2:\n\n   * Lung Function: FEV1 \\< 50 % predicted.\n   * Signs and symptoms of extreme respiratory distress at rest.\n   * Rapid deterioration in
