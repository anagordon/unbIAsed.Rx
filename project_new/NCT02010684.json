Those with low mood and poor glycemic control were offered a 12-week intervention combining cognitive behavioral therapy mood management techniques and diabetes self-care into one seamless intervention. Drs. Mangione and Miranda supervised and reviewed (through audiotapes) well-trained health educators conducting the intervention sessions. The study manuals were modified following this Phase I pilot intervention.\n\nThe final intervention manual was tested in a randomized trial in Phase II, compared the Mood and Diabetes Empowerment and Improvement Training intervention with enhanced care as usual (providing participants with a letter regarding their mood and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c with recommendations for improving care for their provider). The target population was low-income Latinos with depression and poor glycemic control.
