The questionnaire should take about 5-10 minutes to complete.\n* You will have an echocardiogram (ECHO) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check your heart function.\n* You will have blood (about 3 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests. If you can become pregnant, part of this blood draw will be used for a pregnancy test. To take part in this study, you must not be pregnant.\n* You will be given instructions on how to gradually wean yourself off of your heart failure medication.\n* You will be given a machine that you will use to measure your blood pressure at home.\n\nYou will be asked to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate at home daily and keep the results in a diary. You should bring your diary to each study visit.\n\nAt Month 1:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\n* You will complete the questionnaire about any symptoms you may be having.\n* You will have blood (about 2 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests.\n\nAt Months 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 30:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\n* You will complete the questionnaire about any symptoms you may be having.\n* You will have an ECHO.\n* You will have blood (about 2 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests.\n\nAt Months 3 and 5, you will have a telephone follow-up with a member of the research team.\n\nLength of Study Participation:\n\nYou may continue taking part in the study for up to 6 continuous months with follow-up visits at Months 12, 18, and 30. You will no longer be able to take part if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\nThis is an investigational study.\n\nUp to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study.
