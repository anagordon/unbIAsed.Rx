This study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor patient knows the identity of the assigned drug) study of 3 intravenous doses of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered in 1-hr intervals (for a total of 3 hours) in 60 patients with heart failure. Part 2 is an extended infusion of JNJ-39588146 and placebo that will administer the highest tolerated dose from Part 1 for an additional 18 hours. The entire duration of the infusion could be as long as 21 hours. There is a 1 in 4 chance of getting placebo. The participation period is a maximum of 42 days, including a screening visit, a 2-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For both parts of the study, patients will have a cardiac catheter in place to monitor heart function. Safety evaluations, which will include ECG (electrocardiograph, measuring the electrical currents in the heart), vital signs and monitoring of side-effects will be performed. Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected for evaluation. Part 1: Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) solution of three different doses of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered over 1 hour periods for a total of 3 hours. Part 2: Patients participating in the sub study will continue receiving an IV solution for 18 more hours for a total of up to 21 hours of administration."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure", "Cardiac Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 62, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Part 1 (Main Study)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "3 consecutive 1-hour infusions of JNJ-39588146 5, 15, or 30 ng/kg/min or matching placebo", "interventionNames": ["Drug: JNJ-39588146 5 ng/kg/min", "Drug: JNJ-39588146 15 ng/kg/min", "Drug: JNJ-39588146 30 ng/kg/min", "Drug: Placebo"]}, {"label": "Part 2 (Extended Infusion Sub-Study)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "1 18-hr infusion of JNJ-39588146 of the highest tolerated dose from Part 1 of the study or matching placebo", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo", "Drug: JNJ-39588146 5, 15, or 30 ng/kg/min"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "JNJ-39588146 5 ng/kg/min", "description": "1-hour infusion of JNJ-39588146 5 ng/kg/min on Day 1", "armGroupLabels": ["Part 1 (Main Study)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "JNJ-39588146 15 ng/kg/min", "description": "1-hour infusion of JNJ-39588146 15 ng/kg/min on Day 1", "armGroupLabels": ["Part 1 (Main Study)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "JNJ-39588146 30 ng/kg/min", "description": "1-hour infusion of JNJ-39588146 30 ng/kg/min on Day 1", "armGroupLabels": ["Part 1 (Main Study)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "1-hour infusion of matching placebo on Day 1", "armGroupLabels": ["Part 1 (Main Study)", "Part 2 (Extended Infusion Sub-Study)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "JNJ-39588146 5, 15, or 30 ng/kg/min", "description": "18-hour infusion of JNJ-39588146 or matching placebo on Day 1 immediately folllowing the 3-hour infusion at a dose equal to the maximum dose tolerated by that patient during the 3-hour infusion in Part 1 of the study.", "armGroupLabels": ["Part 2 (Extended Infusion Sub-Study)"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Post-baseline Changes Compared to Placebo (at 1-, 2-, and 3-hours Post Infusion Initiation [ie, at the End of 5, 15 and 30 ng/kg/Min Infusions]) in Cardiac Index (CI)", "description": "The effect of JNJ-39588146 on cardiac index (CI), a hemodynamic parameter that relates heart performance to the size of the individual measured in liters per minute per square metre (l/min/m2) was evaluated in patients with heart failure (HF).
