consists of a series of 6 questions (Ease of use rating, Telling how many doses were left in inhaler, Learning how to use inhaler, Handling inhaler, Preparing inhaler and Holding inhaler while using it). Each question had one response to choose from 5 options of ease of use(Very easy, easy, neutral, difficult and very difficult). Participants were asked to rate based on their ease of use experience with device using a scale ranging from 1(very easy) to 5(very difficult). A higher rating indicated that inhaler was difficult to use and a lower rating indicated that inhaler was easy to use. This questionnaire was completed for first device before moving to critical errors assessment of second device. Participant who responded Very Easy or Easy was considered Easy and participant who responded Neutral, Difficult or Very Difficult was considered Difficult. Data has been categorized and reported as Easy and Difficult with respect to each question", "populationDescription": "Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) Population", "reportingStatus": "POSTED", "paramType": "COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS", "unitOfMeasure": "Participants", "timeFrame": "Day 1", "groups": [{"id": "OG000", "title": "ELLIPTA DPI", "description": "Participants received placebo via the ELLIPTA DPI on Day 1 of the study.
