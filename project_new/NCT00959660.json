Exercise intolerance is the primary chronic symptom of HFNEF and a major determinant of these patients' severely reduced quality of life; however little is known regarding its pathophysiology and treatment. Therefore, our work has focused on understanding the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance in HFNEF and developing and testing interventions that may improve this pivotal outcome in this highly prevalent disorder of older persons. The aims of the proposed study are to conduct a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, 2x2 design trial to examine the effects of weight loss via hypocaloric diet, aerobic exercise training, combined hypocaloric diet and exercise training, and attention control in patients with HFNEF and body mass index \\>30 in order to test the following hypotheses: 1) Both weight loss and exercise training will improve exercise intolerance and quality of life in older, obese patients with HFNEF; 2) The combination of weight loss and exercise training will produce complementary effects on body and thigh muscle composition and additive improvements in exercise intolerance in HFNEF; 3) Improvements in exercise intolerance will correlate with improvements in lean body mass, reversal of adverse thigh muscle remodeling, and increased thigh muscle capillarity. The study has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of exercise intolerance and its treatment in the large population of older persons with HFNEF."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure, Diastolic", "Obesity"], "keywords": ["Diastolic heart failure", "Heart Failure", "Elderly", "Obesity"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "FACTORIAL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 100, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Exercise Training", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Exercise participants will undergo a 1-hour supervised exercise program 3 times per week for 20 weeks consisting primarily of walking exercise using an individualized exercise prescription based on the initial exercise stress testing results.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Exercise"]}, {"label": "Dietary Intervention", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "A hypocaloric diet will be developed to achieve a 2800 kcal/week deficit, which should produce about 0.4 kg (1 lb) weight loss per week.", "interventionNames": ["Dietary Supplement: Dietary Intervention"]}, {"label": "Attention control", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Attention control participants will be provided a counseling session regarding general health education at baseline and will be contacted by staff via telephone every 2 weeks to discuss general health status.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Attention Control"]}, {"label": "Diet and Exercise", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "A hypocaloric diet will be developed to achieve a 2450 kcal/week deficit in addition to undergoing a 1-hour supervised exercise program 3 times per week for 20 weeks consisting primarily of walking exercise using an individualized exercise prescription based on the initial exercise stress testing results.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Exercise", "Behavioral: Diet and exercise"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Exercise", "description": "walking, treadmill and bicycle exercise", "armGroupLabels": ["Diet and Exercise", "Exercise Training"]}, {"type": "DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT", "name": "Dietary Intervention", "description": "Subjects will be provided meals and instructions for individual food selections.", "armGroupLabels": ["Dietary Intervention"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Diet and exercise", "description": "Subjects will be provided meals and instructions for individual food selections and will undergo walking, treadmill and bicycle exercise.", "armGroupLabels": ["Diet and Exercise"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Attention Control", "description": "control group- continue their previously randomized life style", "armGroupLabels": ["Attention control"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Exercise Capacity", "description": "Exercise capacity assessed as Peak VO2 (ml/kg/min) via treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing using the modified Naughton protocol to the end point of exhaustion.", "timeFrame": "20 weeks"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Quality of Life", "description": "Heart failure-specific quality of life was assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) on a range 0-100;
