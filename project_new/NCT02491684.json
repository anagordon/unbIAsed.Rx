Patients are screened and enter the Pre-Treatment phase where they remain until they develop symptoms of a common cold or the flu. During this Pre-Treatment Phase patients will be asked daily if they think they have a common cold or the flu. When the patient answers yes to the question that he/she is coming down with a common cold or the flu, arrangements are made to evaluate the patient at the study site and, if eligible, enters the Treatment Phase. Baseline assessments are performed and the patient is randomized 1:1 to receive 24 \u03bcg (metered dose) inhaled Interferon beta-1a or placebo once daily for 14 days (delivered by the I-neb\u00ae device \\[Philips Respironics\\]). Treatment should start as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first of the common cold or flu symptoms. Patients will be assessed with regards to exacerbations and changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use at home using an ePRO device. Lung function will be measured both at home by the patients and at the study site. There will be five clinical visits during the Treatment Phase and two visits after the end of treatment; efficacy and safety will be monitored until 2-3 weeks after end of treatment when a final follow-up visit will take place.\n\nThe study population will comprise adult asthmatic patients on a maintenance treatment of medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a second controller medication (eg, long- acting \u03b22 agonist), with a documented history of at least two severe exacerbations within the last 24 months, of which at least one has occurred during the last 12 months, and it is suspected by the patient that these aforementioned exacerbations were triggered by an upper respiratory tract infection (ie, related to symptoms of a common cold or the flu)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["asthma", "Upper Respiratory Tract Infection", "exacerbation", "Interferon", "efficacy", "safety", "prevention"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 121, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Placebo (matching)", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Placebo, once daily inhalation for 14 days", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}, {"label": "Interferon beta-1a", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Interferon beta-1a, 24 \u03bcg (metered dose) once daily inhalation for 14 days", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Interferon beta-1a Nebuliser solution 48 \u03bcg/mL"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Interferon beta-1a Nebuliser solution 48 \u03bcg/mL", "description": "Interferon beta-1a, 0,5 ml (24 \u03bcg, metered dose) once daily inhalation for 14 days", "armGroupLabels": ["Interferon beta-1a"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Placebo solution for once daily inhalation for 14 days", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo (matching)"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Proportion of Patients With a Severe Asthma Exacerbation During 14 Days of Treatment", "description": "Evaluation of the efficacy of inhaled AZD9412 compared to placebo in preventing severe exacerbations during the 14 day treatment phase following the onset of an URTI in asthmatic patients.\n\nA severe exacerbation was defined as worsening asthma symptoms and\n\n1. use of systemic corticosteroids (or a temporary increase of at least 2-fold in a stable oral corticosteroid background dose) for at least 3 consecutive days and/or\n2. an unscheduled visit or emergency room visit due to asthma symptoms that required at least 1 dose of systemic corticosteroids and/or\n3. an in-patient hospitalisation due to asthma requiring at least 1 dose of systemic corticosteroids.\n\nThe number of patients with severe asthma exacerbations with onset during the treatment phase is presented for each treatment group.", "timeFrame": "Day 1 -
