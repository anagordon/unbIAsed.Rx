People with AERD have symptoms of asthma, severe runny nose, polyps in the nose, and develop allergic reactions if they take medications like aspirin.\n\nPeople with AERD can be desensitized to aspirin in order to be able to safely use it daily, but the investigators do not know if prasugrel may prevent reactions to aspirin and provide a safer way for people with AERD to tolerate aspirin.\n\nThe investigators also want to understand what is different about the cells and urine from subjects who have AERD, in comparison to subjects who have asthma but do not have AERD and subjects who have allergic rhinitis but do not have asthma.
