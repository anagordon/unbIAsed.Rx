Abediterol (AZD0548) is a potential for once daily treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in fixed dose combination (FDC) with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a novel anti-inflammatory agent. The aim of the clinical studies is to enable further investigations in participants with asthma and COPD to evaluate and develop abediterol as an effective long acting bronchodilator with an acceptable safety profile compared to other inhaled bronchodilators on the market, for the treatment of asthma and COPD.", "detailedDescription": "This is a randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, six-way William's design, crossover study to assess the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety of abediterol single dose, given by dry powder inhaler or pressurised metered-dose inhaler, in patients with asthma, on inhaled corticosteroids. During the screening period, all patients will take their own baseline inhaled corticosteroid for 2 weeks. Patients on long-acting \u03b22-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroids will be switched over to the respective inhaled corticosteroid monocomponent. Patients will be provided salbutamol as rescue medication for use throughout the study. Abediterol is an investigational product in early stages of clinical development, therefore individual participants in the clinical studies may not have a clinical benefit, especially in view of alternative therapies (bronchodilators) being available for the treatment of asthma and COPD."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Abediterol", "Dry powder inhaler", "Pressured metered-dose inhaler", "Pharmacokinetic", "Pharmacodynamic", "Safety"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 30, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Abediterol dry powder inhaler 0.156 \u03bcg", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Dry powder for inhalation administered via dry powder inhaler 0.156 \u03bcg/inhalation; (1 inhalation)", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Abediterol 0.156 \u03bcg"]}, {"label": "Abediterol dry powder inhaler 2.5 \u03bcg", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Dry powder for inhalation, administered via dry powder, inhaler 2.5 \u03bcg/inhalation; (1 inhalation).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Abediterol 2.5 \u03bcg"]}, {"label": "Abediterol pressurised metered-dose inhaler 0.05\u03bcg", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose, inhaler 0.025 \u03bcg/puff; (2 puffs).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Abediterol 0.05 \u03bcg"]}, {"label": "Abediterol pressurised metered-dose inhaler 0.156 \u03bcg", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose, inhaler 0.078 \u03bcg/puff; (2 puffs).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Abediterol 0.156 \u03bcg"]}, {"label": "Abediterol pressurised metered-dose inhaler 2.5\u03bcg", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose inhaler 1.25 \u03bcg/puff; (2 puffs).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Abediterol 2.5 \u03bcg"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose inhaler (2 puffs) and Dry powder for inhalation administered via dry powder inhaler (1 inhalation).", "interventionNames": ["Other: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Abediterol 0.156 \u03bcg", "description": "Dry powder for inhalation", "armGroupLabels": ["Abediterol dry powder inhaler 0.156 \u03bcg"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Abediterol 2.5 \u03bcg", "description": "Dry powder for inhalation", "armGroupLabels": ["Abediterol dry powder inhaler 2.5 \u03bcg"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Abediterol 0.05 \u03bcg", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose inhaler", "armGroupLabels": ["Abediterol pressurised metered-dose inhaler 0.05\u03bcg"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Abediterol 0.156 \u03bcg", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose inhaler", "armGroupLabels": ["Abediterol pressurised metered-dose inhaler 0.156 \u03bcg"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Abediterol 2.5 \u03bcg", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose inhaler", "armGroupLabels": ["Abediterol pressurised metered-dose inhaler 2.5\u03bcg"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Pressurised metered-dose inhaler and dry powder for inhalation.", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1).", "description": "Baseline for FEV1 was defined as the mean of the two measured values for the corresponding variable (2 measurements 30 min apart, at -45 min and -15 min), prior to the morning investigational product (IP) administration on Day 1 of each treatment period.
