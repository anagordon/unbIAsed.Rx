However, many individuals who take these medications do not adhere to their prescribed treatment regimen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a telephone-based program at improving medication adherence among individuals with asthma.", "detailedDescription": "Asthma is a serious, chronic disease that affects lung function and impairs an individual's ability to breathe normally. ICS reduce airway inflammation and are often prescribed to treat these conditions. However, poor medication adherence is a common problem that can lead to treatment failure, hospitalization, or death. A telephone-based system that uses interactive voice recognition technology to remind individuals to follow their medication regimen may prove beneficial in promoting adherence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of such a telephone-based intervention at improving adherence to inhaled corticosteroid regimens among individuals with asthma. If this study proves successful, telephone-based interventions may be developed to promote treatment adherence for other chronic medical conditions.\n\nThis 19-month study will enroll approximately 14,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest or Hawaii health system. Participants will be randomly assigned to either take part in the telephone intervention or receive usual medical care. Over the 19-month period, participants in the intervention group will receive between one and eight phone calls that will remind them to refill their prescriptions and offer education about ICS. If needed, the call may also offer a transfer to a pharmacy refill line or to speak with a pharmacist. Approximately 2,000 participants will complete questionnaires at study entry and at the end of the 19-month intervention period. The questionnaires will assess quality of life, respiratory health, asthma control, depression, inhaler use beliefs, and satisfaction with the intervention. Electronic medical record data and questionnaires will be used to determine adherence rates."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Inhaled Corticosteroids", "ICS", "Adherence"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 14064, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Automated Phone-Based Refill Reminders", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Intervention Arm: Participants randomly assigned to this study arm may receive up to 8 automated phone calls from the BREATH EASY Medication Reminder Program over the course of the 19 month intervention period.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Automated Phone-Based Refill Reminders"]}, {"label": "Usual Care", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Usual Care: Participants randomly assigned to this arm received the same introductory letter as those in the intervention arm, giving them the opportunity to opt out, but were subsequently selected to be in the \"usual care\" study arm, and therefore, receive no intervention."}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Automated Phone-Based Refill Reminders", "description": "The BREATHE EASY Medication Reminder Program uses interactive voice recognition phone technology to offer timely reminders to patients to refill their ICS medication, educational messages about ICS, and may offer to transfer them to a refill line or to speak with a pharmacist if they have questions.", "armGroupLabels": ["Automated Phone-Based Refill Reminders"], "otherNames": ["The BREATHE EASY Medication Reminder Program"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Modified Medication Possession Ratio", "description": "We used a modification of the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) as our primary outcome measure.
