On April 9, 2009, President Barack Obama directed the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense to create the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER). On August 2010, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki visited Indianapolis, and after visiting with leaders from the VA Health Services Research \\& Development (HSR\\&D) Center of Excellence and the Regenstrief Institute, he made the following public comments regarding the latest partnership between the two institutions: \"This new technology allows safer, more secure, and private access to electronic health information which, in turn, enhances our ability to continue providing Veterans with the quality care that they have earned.\"\n\nThis new technology refers to the VLER HEALTH program that the Indianapolis VA is now implementing in partnership with the Regenstrief Institute and Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE). This VA-IHIE demonstration project is intended to create the capacity for VA institutions to exchange health information with community partners.\n\nInvestigators from the VA HSR\\&D Center on Implementing Evidence-Based Practice are active collaborators in building and implementing this program. The VA-IHIE program provides the bi-directional exchange of health information between VA and non-VA providers. Based on our pilot study of linked VA-IHIE data, investigators are conducting an evaluation of the impact of the VA-IHIE demonstration project upon health care quality and cost of Veterans by taking advantage of the initiation of the implementation as a natural experiment.", "detailedDescription": "This study will perform a pre-post evaluation of the VA-IHIE implementation, with a concurrent control group, among Veterans seen at the Indianapolis VA. Data on care received by Veterans will be obtained for one year before, and one year after, VA-IHIE enrollment. Patients will be recruited into the VA-IHIE program in a rolling manner over the course of a year, and thus will have different calendar intervals of follow-up. For purposes of evaluation, investigators will approach the VA-IHIE implementation as a patient-directed intervention given that additional information available from the exchange is available only on a patient-by-patient basis, i.e., a provider cannot use exchange information available for one patient in the care of another. Although the VA-IHIE program will be implemented at the site level, patients will be enrolled individually."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes Mellitus", "Asthma", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Heart Failure", "Osteoporosis"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "COHORT", "timePerspective": "RETROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 57073, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "No Exchange", "description": "Patients in this arm will represent Veterans seen at the Indianapolis VA Medical Center (VAMC) for whom information exchange has not been activated.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Non-Active Health Information exchange"]}, {"label": "Enrolled in Exchange", "description": "Patients in this arm will represent Veterans seen at the Indianapolis VAMC for whom information exchange has been activated by the patient choosing to \"opt-in.\"", "interventionNames": ["Other: Active Health Information Exchange"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Active Health Information Exchange", "description": "Patients selected to share data between the VA \\& external healthcare agencies.", "armGroupLabels": ["Enrolled in Exchange"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Non-Active Health Information exchange", "description": "Patients not selecting to share data", "armGroupLabels": ["No Exchange"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Understanding Utilization of Healthcare Procedures by Veterans According to Source of Data", "description": "Determining rates of usage of healthcare by veterans by source of data.
