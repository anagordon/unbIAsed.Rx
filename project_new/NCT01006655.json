Specific treatment, nowadays, include steroid inhalers and anti leukotrienes. It is known that the amount of the drug reaching small airways and lungs is bigger how much smaller the particles liberated by inhalers. Beclometasone is being used for treating asthma for 30 years. Lately emerged a new presentation of beclometasone, which liberates particles as small as 2.1 \u00b5g, that is supposed to reach the small airways at higher concentrations and be more suitable to patients who don't cooperate properly to the procedure of inhalation.\n\nThe investigators' group has reported successfully the possibility to perform Pulmonary Challenge tests (adenosine, methacholine and exercise) in tender age. Other studies reported relation between asthma control and reduction in airway hyperreactivity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Beclometasone dipropionate - Qvar to reduce airways hyperreactivity in preschool children, as demonstrated by adenosine challenge test.", "detailedDescription": "26 - 30 patients, between 3 -6 years old, mild asthmatics, with positive adenosine challenge test, will received in a randomized, double blind, cross over assignment Beclometasone dipropionate (100\u00b5g twice a day) or placebo, through an inhaler (autohaler) device, attached to a spacer device, during four consecutive weeks. Adenosine Challenge test will be performed another time at the end of this four weeks period. After 2 weeks with no medication (wash out period) the patients will receive the second intervention (beclometasone dipropionate or placebo) in a cross over manner and will be submitted to the last adenosine challenge test.\n\nClinical evaluation, resting spirometry and subjective evaluation through an analogical symptoms scale will be recorded in each visit."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma", "Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness"], "keywords": ["asthma", "preschool children", "bronchial hyperresponsiveness", "beclometasone dipropionate - HFA", "Qvar", "Adenosine Challenge test"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 21, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "placebo, adenosine challenge test", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Controlled or partially controlled multiple trigger wheezing children received 4 weeks of placebo, preceded and succeeded by AMP challenge test,", "interventionNames": ["Drug: placebo"]}, {"label": "Qvar, adenosine challenge test", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Patients will receive 4 weeks of inhale QVAR (HFA beclomethasone) 100\u00b5g through a spacer device, twice a day", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA", "description": "100\u00b5g twice a day, through inhaler autohaler, using a spacer device, preceded and followed by adenosine challenge test", "armGroupLabels": ["Qvar, adenosine challenge test"], "otherNames": ["Qvar"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "placebo", "description": "inhalation twice a day for one month, preceded and followed by adenosine challenge test", "armGroupLabels": ["placebo, adenosine challenge test"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Adenosine Challenge Test", "description": "Adenosine challenge test were measured and described as PC 20 - the concentration that corresponded to a FEV1 impairment equal or bigger than 20%.
