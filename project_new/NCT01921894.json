Severe disease exacerbations account for the majority of costs attributable to asthma in the United States. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient with significant immuno-modulatory effects. The observation that vitamin D insufficiency and asthma share risk factors such as urban residence, obesity, and African American ethnicity has generated significant interest in exploring a link between these two conditions.\n\nThis is an 8-week randomized, double-masked, controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day and 4,000 IU/day) to achieve vitamin D sufficiency (a serum 25(OH)D \u226530
