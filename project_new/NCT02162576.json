The Asthma Data Innovation Demonstration Project (ADID) will use wireless sensor technology to develop spatial and temporal data on the use of rescue inhalers by 120 study subjects with asthma in the Louisville metropolitan area. Propeller Health will process these data to support two general strategies.\n\nAsthma self management: Rescue inhaler actuation data will be compiled into individualized feedback reports to support asthma self management. Propeller Health will combine information on individual rescue inhaler actuations with evidence-based asthma management tips into real-time reports that will be provided to subjects. ADID staff will evaluate any resulting improvements in asthma control that may be based on this information. Subjects may share reports with their healthcare providers.\n\nMunicipal purposes: The second strategy is to provide aggregated and de-identified, spatial and temporal asthma rescue inhaler actuation data to City personnel and authorized public health researchers in Louisville. These data will show the times and locations of the use of rescue inhalers by the 120 study subjects throughout the greater Louisville area. ADID staff will work with City personnel and researchers to investigate how this unprecedented level of detailed information on exacerbations can be used best to increase public awareness of environmental triggers while supporting public health surveillance efforts around respiratory diseases."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma", "Bronchial Diseases", "Respiratory Tract Diseases", "Lung Diseases, Obstructive", "Lung Diseases", "Respiratory Hypersensitivity", "Hypersensitivity, Immediate", "Hypersensitivity", "Immune System Diseases"], "keywords": ["asthma", "asthma control", "healthcare utilization costs", "community hotspots", "public health research"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 95, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Propeller Health intervention group", "type": "OTHER", "description": "All participants attached the Propeller sensor to their SABA medications and tracked the time and location of use for up to 13 months, to capture seasonal variation in medication use, symptoms and environmental triggers.
