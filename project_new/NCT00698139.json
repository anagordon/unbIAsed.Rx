As a result, they may be unable to mobilize excess fluid that their body retains. We hypothesize that we can provide assistance to their body in mobilizing this fluid by artificially increasing their heart rate using a pacemaker. We plan to conduct a prospective clinical trial to evaluate this hypothesis.\n\nWe will use a cross over design to study patients who already have biventricular pacemakers implanted or a narrow QRS and volume overload. We will screen them using a blood test that is a rough estimate of volume overload. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to have their pacemakers adjusted or to have no intervention during the first of 2 visits. They will be unaware of which group they are in. Following adjustment, they will be monitored for six hours.\n\nPrior to the pacemaker adjustment, several tests will be performed to evaluate heart function and the levels of hormones related that are affected by heart failure. These tests will be repeated at the end of the six hour intervention period in each visit. At the end of the visit patients who had their pacemakers adjusted will have it reset to their original settings.", "detailedDescription": "Many patients with heart failure suffer from chronotropic incompetence, an inability to raise their heart rate in response to metabolic demand. Previous studies have shown that brief increases in pacing rates in patients with biventricular pacemakers can improve cardiac contractility. We hypothesize that the benefits of an increased biventricular pacing rate could be sustained and would improve cardiovascular and neurohormonal parameters in patients suffering from volume overload. We intend to prospectively evaluate this hypothesis in a single blind randomized cross-over design trial.\n\nWe will screen 40 patients who have previously implanted biventricular pacemakers (or a narrow QRS) and an elevated B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level. Following enrollment, patients will be randomly assigned to have their atrial pacing rate increased to 85 beats per minute or to be unchanged during the first of 2 visits. Patients will be unaware of their treatment assignment. They will be observed for six hours in a monitored setting. The primary outcome will be cardiac output, as measured noninvasively by NICOM (Cheetah Medical Inc., Israel) system before and after the observation period. Secondary outcomes will include changes in neurohormonal measures and thoracic impedance. If this proof-of-concept study demonstrates a positive effect, future research would evaluate the ability of increased pacing rates to prevent or abort decompensation of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["heart failure", "chronotropic incompetence"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 3, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention first, then control", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Ambulatory out-patients will be identified at Columbia-Presbyterian and New York University Medical Centers.\n\nOn the first encounter, patients will come to clinic in the morning for baseline measurements.
