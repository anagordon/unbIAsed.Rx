But investigators first need to establish whether the weight loss intervention is effective in patients with asthma.\n\nObjectives\n\n1.

The ultimate purpose is to implement a multi-center weight loss intervention trial for obese patients with poorly controlled asthma.", "detailedDescription": "This will be a pilot study of a weight loss intervention at two centers, the University of Arizona and the University of Vermont.

Such designs are widely used in efficiently informing decisions to proceed to Phase III clinical trials.
