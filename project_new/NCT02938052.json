The MGH inpatient units and MGH Heart Center outpatients will serve as the source of subjects for the study, with patients who have a diagnosis of HF serving as potential subjects. The investigators will enroll 10 HF patients, who will take part in an 10-week PP-based health behavior intervention.\n\nIn this project, the investigators hope to do the following:\n\n1. Test an 10-week, telephone-delivered health behavior intervention utilizing PP exercises and systematic goal-setting in a brief, non-randomized, proof-of-concept trial (N=10).\n2. Determine whether this initial intervention is feasible in a small cohort of HF patients.\n3. Explore potential benefits of the intervention on outcomes of interest (e.g., optimism, positive affect).\n\nBaseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from the patients, care providers, and the electronic medical record as required for characterization of our population. This information will include data regarding medical history (history of prior acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery bypass graft, congestive HF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking), current medical variables (renal function, left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA class), medications, and sociodemographic data (age, gender, race/ethnicity, living alone).\n\nParticipants will under go an initial visit during which they will meet with study staff in person (or if preferred over the phone).\n\n\u2022 They will fill out baseline questionnaires, and be provided a treatment manual with weekly exercises, along with a copy of Learning to Live with Heart Failure. The PP and goal-setting portions of the intervention will be introduced, and the first exercise will be assigned. Finally, participants will be provided an ActiGraph accelerometer to wear for 7 days, as well as a personal step counter to keep.\n\nParticipants will undergo weekly phone sessions for 10 weeks.\n\n* For the positive psychology segment the participant will review the previous week's exercise, discuss of the rationale of the next week's exercise, and be assigned the next week's exercise.\n* For the goal-setting segment the participant will review the health goal from the prior week, receive education about a health behavior, discuss ways to improve health behaviors, and set a goal for the next week.\n\nParticipants will undergo a follow-up phone call at 10 weeks that asks the same questions that were answered during the initial visit, as well as questions about their experience using the ActiGraph.\n\n\u2022 At Week 10, participants will wear another ActiGraph for 7 days."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Congestive Heart Failure", "Emotions", "Patient Compliance"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure", "Positive Psychology", "Adherence to Health Behaviors"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 10, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention Arm", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will all undergo a 10-week PP-based health behavior intervention and adherence measurements (baseline and Week 10).\n\nThe participants will receive an ActiGraph accelerometer.
