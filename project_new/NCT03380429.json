Additionally, a sensor will be attached to the rescue medication metered dose inhaler (MDI). The data from both sensors will be fed back to the subject via an application (app) on smart phone and will be reviewed by the subject's health care professional (HCP) via an online dashboard. The sensors, app, dashboard and systems to provide data comprise the CIS. This study will be the first to evaluate the effect of CIS on adherence to maintenance therapy in subjects with uncontrolled asthma. This is an open-label, randomized, parallel group study in asthmatic subjects currently on a fixed dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) maintenance therapy. Eligible subjects will receive RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae maintenance therapy via ELLIPTA DPI and salbutamol rescue medication via MDI with sensors attached to both inhalers during the run-in period, which may last for up to 3 months. Eligible subjects will then be randomized into five treatment arms depending on whether the data, from RELVAR/BREO ELLIPTA or RELVAR/BREO ELLIPTA and salbutamol MDI, is fed back to the subject or subject and HCP, or not at all. The treatment period for the study is approximately 6 months and there will be a follow-up period one week post last visit. The total duration of a subject in the study will be approximately 9 months.
