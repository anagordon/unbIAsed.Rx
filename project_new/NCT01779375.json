Pediatric participants (ages 10-19) will be randomized to one of the following treatment regimens: (1) metformin alone or (2) early intensive treatment with basal insulin glargine followed by metformin.\n\nThe primary clinical question RISE will address is: Are improvements in \u00df-cell function following 12 months of active treatment maintained for 3 months following the withdrawal of therapy? Secondary outcomes will assess durability of glucose tolerance following withdrawal of therapy, and whether biomarkers obtained in the fasting state predict parameters of \u00df-cell function, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and the response to an intervention."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Prediabetes", "Type 2 Diabetes"], "keywords": ["Children", "Pediatric"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 91, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Metformin alone", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Metformin will be titrated to the maximum dose tolerated (up to 2000 mg/day).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Metformin"]}, {"label": "Glargine followed by Metformin", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Basal insulin glargine for 3 months titrated to achieve a morning fasting blood glucose of 85-95 mg/dl, followed by metformin (titrated up to 2000 mg/day) for 9 months.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Metformin", "Drug: Glargine"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Metformin", "armGroupLabels": ["Glargine followed by Metformin", "Metformin alone"], "otherNames": ["Glucophage"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Glargine", "armGroupLabels": ["Glargine followed by Metformin"], "otherNames": ["Insulin glargine, Lantus"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "\u00df-cell Response Measured by Hyperglycemic Clamp", "description": "Clamp measures of \u00df-cell response, co-primary outcomes", "timeFrame": "3-months after medication washout (Month 15)"}, {"measure": "M/I", "description": "Clamp measure of insulin sensitivity", "timeFrame": "3-months after a medication washout"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "ACPRg", "description": "First phase response", "timeFrame": "3-months after a medication washout"}, {"measure": "\u00df-cell Function Measured by Hyperglycemic Clamp Techniques at M12", "description": "Participants had 12-months of active therapy.
