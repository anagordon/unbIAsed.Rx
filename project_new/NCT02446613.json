Subjects and staff will remain blinded to the treatment received in the TL7116958 study (GSK2245035 or placebo). The study will consist of a screening visit to assess eligibility criteria, a study period consisting of a single visit when the nasal allergen challenge will be performed, and follow up by phone or a clinic visit at the discretion of the investigator 4-7 days following the allergen challenge.
