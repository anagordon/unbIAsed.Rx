We are calling this project \"asthma-free schools\" and bringing it to neighborhoods where the incidence of asthma is especially high. We have designed this study to work with school-based asthma care programs. Children with high-risk asthma will be asked to participate. \"High-risk\" will be defined as poorly controlled asthma, frequent school absences, and/or need for daily controller asthma medications. We will use a commercially available inhaler cap sensor to help track medication use and symptoms through a smartphone. The study visits will be done mostly at the school using telehealth technology similar to Skype.", "detailedDescription": "This study is part of a community health collaboration between Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), the local public health department and designated inner city schools. The purpose is to address school-based asthma care barriers and then to test the efficacy of this program in a pilot study to improve asthma outcomes in 30 urban core youth.\n\nGreater Cincinnati's geography places it at the environmentally tricky confluence of low-lying smog-trapping hills, three heavily traveled interstate highways, and high rate of allergen exposure. This makes it an area ripe for asthma. The overall rate of pediatric asthma in Greater Cincinnati is more than twice the national average and, in some urban-core neighborhoods, as high as 10 times the national rate.\n\nPoor asthma control across the nation and locally in Cincinnati is associated with an overrepresentation of children from minority groups, low-income families, and single parent households who deal with economic hardship and familial strain compared to those with well-controlled asthma. Data show that no more than 50% of patients keep appointments or fill prescriptions, leading to continued poor asthma control and risk for future exacerbation.\n\nThis is an interventional pilot study where about 30 high-risk asthmatic participants will be identified to participate and a number of interventions will be incorporated including asthma specific questionnaires, use of a commercially available inhaler cap with monitoring sensor, a mobile software management platform that tracks adherence of all asthma medications, mobile based telehealth medical visits to assess asthma control, and mobile based telehealth adherence problem-solving interventions.\n\nThis proposal is funded through a Luther Foundation and Verizon Foundation philanthropic gifts."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Telehealth", "Sensor cap", "School based care", "Community health", "AsthmaTreatSmart Application"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 21, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Single arm asthma self-management", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Interventions include:\n\nSensor cap system for inhalers App for SmartPhone Motivational interviews Telehealth clinic visits", "interventionNames": ["Device: Sensor cap system for inhalers", "Other: App for SmartPhone", "Behavioral: Motivational interviews", "Other: Telehealth clinic visits"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Sensor cap system for inhalers", "description": "All subjects will be given a commercially available inhaler cap with monitoring sensor on clinically prescribed asthma inhalers.", "armGroupLabels": ["Single arm asthma self-management"], "otherNames": ["Propeller"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "App for SmartPhone", "description": "All subjects will be given smart phone with mobile software management platform to motivate and record medication adherence.", "armGroupLabels": ["Single arm asthma self-management"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Motivational interviews", "description": "All subjects will have motivational telehealth visits to assess adherence and promote problem-solving skills", "armGroupLabels": ["Single arm asthma self-management"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Telehealth clinic visits", "description": "All subjects will have asthma medical visits via telehealth technology to assess asthma control.", "armGroupLabels": ["Single arm asthma self-management"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Change in Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI) Score", "description": "Change in composite asthma severity index score (Baseline CASI score-6 month CASI score).
