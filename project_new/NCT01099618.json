Subjects on pills will be followed for 3\u00bd years and undergo blood tests at specified intervals to assess their ability to make insulin. These studies will allow a better understanding of the factors that lead to high blood sugar in patients with ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus (KPDM) and direct the best diabetes treatment for this patient population.\n\nHypothesis: Metformin therapy or sitagliptin therapy compared to placebo, will improve \u03b2-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and allow for a longer period of time prior to encountering an insulin-deficient relapse after discontinuation of insulin therapy."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Ketosis Prone Diabetes", "Diabetes Ketoacidosis", "Hyperglycemia"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 48, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Metformin", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "All newly diagnosed subjects with KPDM that are able to discontinue insulin after 12 weeks or less will be randomized in double-blind fashion to receive either metformin 1000mg, sitagliptin 100mg or placebo once daily.
