The investigators are testing two medication reminder systems and the investigators want to know which one people like better. The investigators also want to see if they have any effect on ease of managing medication in individuals with heart failure.", "detailedDescription": "A pilot and feasibility randomized trial of two medication reminder systems for patients with heart failure (HF). The investigators believe that medication reminder systems will improve adherence and will reduce the effects of cognitive impairment on medication adherence. The investigators believe that patients will accept and use a medication reminder system, but the investigators cannot specify which system will be preferred. Each has different features which may be perceived as more or less desirable.\n\nThe investigators will enroll 60 patients with HF and randomize them to four conditions in a 2 (device 1 versus device 2) by 2 (Active versus Passive) design. After enrollment in the trial, patients will be consented and will complete pretesting at Summa Health System in the Center for Clinical Trials. They will primarily undergo brief computerized cognitive testing, complete self-report measures (e.g., quality of life, depression, self-management related social support), and will give consent for medical information to be collected from their electronic medical record. They will then be randomized to condition. In-home training will be provided regarding how to use the equipment. Medication adherence will be monitored for 28 days, followed by an in-home post-test (all pre-test measures) during which the equipment is returned."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "BASIC_SCIENCE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 60, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Device 2 passive", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Device 2 will NOT remind patients to take medications", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Non-reminding"]}, {"label": "Device 2 active", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Device 2 will remind patients to take medications", "interventionNames": ["Device: iPhone or pillbox"]}, {"label": "Device 1 active", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Device 1 will remind patients to take their medications", "interventionNames": ["Device: iPhone or pillbox"]}, {"label": "Device 1 Passive", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Device 1 will NOT remind patients to take medications.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Non-reminding"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "iPhone or pillbox", "description": "People will be reminded to take their medications by a device that alerts the patient to the need to take a medication.", "armGroupLabels": ["Device 1 active", "Device 2 active"]}, {"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Non-reminding", "description": "As a comparison, the devices will collect medication taking information without providing reminders.", "armGroupLabels": ["Device 1 Passive", "Device 2 passive"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Patient Acceptance", "description": "Patient ratings of their satisfaction with the device, ease of use, and other impressions.
