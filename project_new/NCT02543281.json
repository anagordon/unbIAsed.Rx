CRT without the adaptive algorithm works by giving stimulation to both sides of the heart. aCRT has already been approved by the FDA and is being used in patients now, but it is not clear which patients it should be used in compared to normal CRT. This study will include patients who are already scheduled to get a CRT device. The investigators will then randomize patients to the aCRT study arm or to the CRT study arm. After 6 months, the investigators will assess the electrical activity of the patients' hearts. After this time, the patient and their doctors will be able to decide if they would like to change the type CRT they have been designated."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Cardiomyopathy", "Heart Failure", "Left Bundle Branch Block"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 32, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "aCRT Off", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "The adaptive CRT algorithm will be turned off for the CRT device implanted in the patients in this arm.", "interventionNames": ["Device: Conventional Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy"]}, {"label": "aCRT On", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The adaptive CRT algorithm will be turned on for the CRT device implanted in the patients in this arm.", "interventionNames": ["Device: Adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy"]}, {"label": "Registry arm", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Participants who are not eligible for the randomization because of the implantation of the device that is not capable of delivering aCRT.
