Cannulation will be done through the aorta and the right atrium and the patient will be put on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patient's heart will be freed from the surrounding tissues. With a cylindrical blade, the surgeon will excise a core of myocardium from the apex. The LVAD sewing ring will then be sutured to the margins of the apical hole. The LVAD will be inserted into the LV cavity through the sewing ring. The outflow graft will be measured for the anastomosis into the aortic root. Partial occlusion clamp will be placed on the aortic root and the anastomosis will be performed. De-airing will be performed and the LVAD will be started.
