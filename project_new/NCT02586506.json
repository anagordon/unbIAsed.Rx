Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), alone or in combination with inhaled long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (LABA), are considered a mainstay of treatment for treatment. For inhaled medications, the choice of inhalation device is an important consideration because an inadequate technique reduces the delivery of medicines and effects of inhalation. Therefore, the development of an easy-to-use inhaler that delivers the drug to the lungs effectively, is important. This study is designed to assess the correct use of the ELLIPTA inhaler in subjects with asthma and also to assess ease of use of the ELLIPTA inhaler, as rated by those subjects determined to be using the inhaler correctly. Study will be divided into two visits i.e. Screening/Visit 1 (day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 28 +/-2) with a phone call on Day 8+/-2 days of Visit 1 to assess safety. In this multi-center, single-arm, randomised (to receive one of two versions of the ELLIPTA inhaler Ease of Use questionnaires), open-label, placebo study, only subjects who are have never used the ELLIPTA inhaler before and have an established diagnosis of asthma and receiving asthma therapy and are able to demonstrate correct use of the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 1 will be considered eligible to participate in this study. Approximately 252 subjects will be screened with an expectation of 208 subjects completing the study while demonstrating correct ELLIPTA inhaler use at visit 2.\n\nELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline Group of Companies."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["correct use of inhaler", "dose left", "ease of use", "ELLIPTA", "Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "OTHER", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 259, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Placebo ELLIPTA inhaler", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects will be provided the ELLIPTA inhaler, which is a molded plastic two-sided inhaler that holds two individual blister strips containing either lactose or a blend of lactose and magnesium stearate.
