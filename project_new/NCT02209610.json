Premature fatigue may be attributed to a) contraction-induced transient changes within muscles (i.e. peripheral fatigue) and/or b) failure of the central nervous system to 'drive' / activate locomotor muscles (i.e. central fatigue). Both determinants of fatigue can lead to a reduction in a muscle's force and power generating capacity and to a compromised ability to perform whole body activities (e.g. walking). Recent findings in health have documented that group III/IV afferent fibers from the working muscle play a critical role in the development of both components of fatigue. Specifically, group III/IV muscle afferents limit central motor drive (CMD) during exercise and thereby exaggerate the development of central fatigue. In contrast, muscle afferents optimize muscle O2 delivery through the precise regulation of circulation and ventilation during exercise and thereby attenuate the development of peripheral fatigue.", "detailedDescription": "Recent findings in HF suggest an altered effect of group III/IV muscle afferents in this population. Although normal afferent feedback is crucial for adequate O2 delivery during exercise, excessive neural feedback has substantial negative consequences. HF patients are characterized by augmented neural feedback arising from overactive muscle afferents. It has been hypothesized that this abnormality compromises locomotor muscle O2 delivery in these patients. Therefore, the abnormally elevated muscle afferent feedback in HF might exacerbate, compared to healthy age- and activity matched individuals (CTRLs), the development of both peripheral (via limiting O2 delivery) and central (via restricting CMD) fatigue during exercise. Recent advances in non-invasive stimulation techniques offer a genuine opportunity to identify the sites and synaptic mechanisms that mediate central and peripheral fatigue including alterations in the responsiveness of the corticospinal tract (i.e. a determinant of central fatigue). Taken together, the proposed studies aim to determine the impact of HF on the precise development of central and peripheral fatigue during both whole body and single muscle exercise and evaluate the extent to which group III/IV muscle afferents contribute to this development."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["EARLY_PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "BASIC_SCIENCE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 32, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Patients With Heart Failure: Neuromuscular Abnormalities", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Patients with Heart Failure", "interventionNames": ["Device: Electrical and Magnetic Nerve Stimulators", "Drug: Intrathecal Fentanyl"]}, {"label": "Health Control Subjects and Neuromuscular Function", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Health Control Subjects", "interventionNames": ["Device: Electrical and Magnetic Nerve Stimulators", "Drug: Intrathecal Fentanyl"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Electrical and Magnetic Nerve Stimulators", "description": "Stimulation of motor nerve and central nervous system", "armGroupLabels": ["Health Control Subjects and Neuromuscular Function", "Patients With Heart Failure: Neuromuscular Abnormalities"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Intrathecal Fentanyl", "description": "Mu-opioid receptor agonist", "armGroupLabels": ["Health Control Subjects and Neuromuscular Function", "Patients With Heart Failure: Neuromuscular Abnormalities"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Maximal Voluntary Quadriceps Force [% Change From Baseline]", "description": "Following dynamic single leg knee extension exercise for a given duration (4-8 min), the decline in maximal voluntary contraction force will be measured.", "timeFrame": "1 minute after exercise on study day"}, {"measure": "Quadriceps Twitch Force and Voluntary Activation (% Change From Baseline)", "description": "During a 2-min maximal voluntary quadriceps contraction, central and peripheral fatigue will develop progressively and significantly more in HF vs. CTRLs.", "timeFrame": "During (20 second intervals) and 1 minute after exercise on study day"}, {"measure": "Muscle Afferent Affect", "description": "Corticospinal responsiveness will be quantified before and after exercise.", "timeFrame": "1 minute after exercise on study day"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* subjects with a history of stable cardiomyopathy (ischemic and non-ischemic, \\>1yr duration, ages 20-75 yr),\n* not pacemaker dependent (no biventricular pacers),\n* NYHA class II and III symptoms,\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\\<35%,\n* no or minimal smoking history (\\<15 pk yrs) and on stable medications.\n* The investigators will also study subjects with preserved ejection fraction\n\n  * heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF);\n  * LVEF \\>50%,\n  * \\>1yr duration,\n  * ages 20-75 yr,\n* not pacemaker dependent,\n* NYHA class II and III symptoms,\n* no or minimal smoking history (\\<15 pk yrs) and on stable medications.
