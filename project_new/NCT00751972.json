Secondary endpoints include:\n\n* Overall survival\n* Incidence of all serious adverse events, neurocognitive status and unanticipated adverse device effects.\n* Incidence of all device failures and device malfunctions\n* Quality of Life improvement, as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and EuroQoL EQ-5D\n* Functional status improvement, as measured by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) and 6-minute walk\n\nThe HeartWare\u00ae LVAD System was approved by the US FDA on November 20, 2012 as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (reference PMA P100047).
