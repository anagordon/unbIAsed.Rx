Together with our partners and stakeholders, the investigators have designed a study to determine whether PARTICS can improve outcomes that are important to patients when superimposed on a background provider-educated standard care through the Asthma IQ system. The investigators therefore propose a study entitled PREPARE: Patient Empowered Strategy to Reduce Asthma Morbidity in Highly Impacted Populations. The aim is to determine whether a PARTICS strategy can reduce asthma morbidity in AA and H/L. The primary outcome will be asthma exacerbations which have been shown to be important to patient and healthcare stakeholders. The secondary outcomes will include additional outcomes important to patients (i.e. days lost from work or school, asthma control, \\& asthma quality of life). The investigators have broad input and involvement from multiple stakeholder groups in study design, implementation, and commitments for dissemination. AA and H/L patients and their advocates have been involved and will continue to play a central role in all phases of the study."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["asthma", "African Americans", "Hispanics"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1220, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "PARTICS", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "addition of PARTICS strategy - Patient Activated Reliever-Triggered Inhaled CorticoSteroid (PARTICS) using QVAR .
