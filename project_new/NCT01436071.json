Subjects meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria during Visit 1 (Screening Visit) will enter a two week Run-in Period. Subjects failing screening will not be eligible for re-screening. During the run-in and double-blind treatment periods subjects will maintain an electronic daily diary to record morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma symptom score and rescue albuterol/salbutamol use. At Visit 2 (end of run-in/Randomisation Visit), subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomised to either inhaled Fluticasone Furoate 50 mcg or inhaled placebo. In addition all subjects will be supplied with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol to use as required to treat symptoms. Subjects will attend 4 on-treatment visits at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 respectively). Subjects will receive treatment for 84 days (12 weeks). A follow-up contact will be performed 1-week after completing study medication (Visit 7).
