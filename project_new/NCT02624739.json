It will consist of two arms: (i) intervention, and (ii) control. Participants will be randomized to either arm at time of enrollment. Every participant enrolled in the study will receive a device for remote monitoring.", "detailedDescription": "Heart failure ('HF') presents an increasing social and economic burden, especially with respect to HF related hospitalizations. Some commentators suggest that these costs may double within the next two decades. Respiration patterns are well acknowledged as having diagnostic and prognostic value in HF. In this preliminary study, the investigators assess the usability of remote monitoring of respiration parameters in the routine management of HF patients.\n\nObjectives: (primary and important secondary objectives)\n\nThe primary aims are:\n\n1. Assess usability of the system (primary measurement is % of successful data transmissions from participants' homes, secondary measurement includes scores from the System Usability Scale)\n2. Assess quality of life (as measured using the KCCQ) for HF patients monitored with a non-contact respiration monitor which can be used by clinicians to guide standard therapy.\n\nOther key secondary objectives include examining trends in healthcare utilization, descriptively assessing any differences in care patterns post hoc between participants.\n\nAs part of the study plan , the investigators will also analyze respiration and sleeping patterns from the raw data files to assess the prevalence of unusual breathing patterns such as sleep apnea in newly discharged HF patients and how these patterns may be linked to outcomes. These analyses will be executed retrospectively on a population rather than individual participant basis and will not be used to inform individual treatment plans."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["respiration rate, sleep"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 17, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Reassure Non-Contact Respiration Monitor: Respiration parameters transmitted by the Reassure device will be evaluated daily by the study team and participants will be contacted for further evaluation if a change in respiration patterns is noted.
