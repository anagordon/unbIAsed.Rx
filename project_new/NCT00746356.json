If the test is successful, the patient's device will be programmed to turn that feature on. 3 months after enrollment, the patient will return to the clinic to have their device re-tested using an automatic test method to measure the amount of energy needed to make the patient's heart beat. A manual test method will also be used to measure the amount of energy needed to make the patient's heart beat.
