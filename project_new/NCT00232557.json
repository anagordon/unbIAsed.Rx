Despite the availability of effective therapy for asthma, morbidity and mortality have increased over the last several decades. Asthma specialty care, case management, and patient education are means for improving the quality of asthma care and patient outcomes, but cost and inconvenience limit the degree to which these are used in asthma care nationally. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of an inexpensive telephone-based home education and disease monitoring system on asthma medication adherence and clinical outcomes in adult patients with asthma.\n\nObjective(s):\n\nWe hypothesize that application of TLC to the care of adult patients with asthma will improve self-management by enhancing compliance with preventive medication regimens and fostering the use of peak flow-based action plans. This, in turn, will improve asthma control, thus reducing acute health care utilization and improving quality of life (QOL).\n\nMethods:\n\nA randomized controlled trial will be conducted with adult asthma patients identified from the VA Boston Healthcare System comprised of the Boston, West Roxbury, and Brockton VA Medical Centers and their associated satellite clinics. Patients will be randomized to either the TLC-Asthma group or an attention placebo control group. Outcome measurements will include medication adherence, QOL, utilization of urgent care services, oral corticosteroid use."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma",
