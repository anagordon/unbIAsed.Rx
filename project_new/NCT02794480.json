Therefore, the study aims to evaluate errors encountered by subject with asthma during handling ELLIPTA DPI relative to two metered dose inhalers (MDI), a GSK MDI and the AstraZeneca (AZ) MDI. It is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over study comparing placebo ELLIPTA DPI with placebo MDI (GSK and AZ) to assess correct inhaler use. No active drug will be used in this study in order to prevent any drug-related effects. Approximately, 152 subjects will be randomized to receive ELLIPTA DPI inhaler and 152 will be randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers, for use during the first period (P) (approximately 28 days). At Visit 2 (Day 28) all subjects previous receiving the ELLIPTA DPI will be randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers and all subjects who received a MDI in the previous period will receive the ELLIPTA DPI for use during second period (approximately 28 days). Subjects will continue taking their asthma maintenance treatment and limited rescue albuterol MDI during the entire 56-day study period.\n\nELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GSK group of companies."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["ELLIPTA", "metered dose inhaler", "Dry powder inhaler"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 324, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Placebo ELLIPTA DPI (QD) in P1 and Placebo AZ MDI (BD) in P2", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Eligible subject will receive ELLIPTA DPI taken as one inhalation once daily (QD) for 28 days and Placebo AZ MDI taken as two inhalations twice daily (BD) for next 28 days.
