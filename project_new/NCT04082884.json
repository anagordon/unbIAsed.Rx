The study will consist of 4 in person or virtual visits which will take place over \\~7 weeks. All participants will be initially studied for 2 weeks while ingesting a standard diet recommended by the American Diabetes Association, followed by a 1-week transition to a VLCD, and followed by 2 weeks on each type of VLCD (high protein, high fat). During the first (baseline) period fasting \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels will be measured 2-3 times per week. During the VLCD study periods, fasting \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels will be measured daily in the morning using a blood ketone meter; insulin doses will be collected using insulin pump downloads and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles will be used to assess glycemic excursions on each diet, as well as the time in hypo-, eu- and hyperglycemic ranges. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in sensor glucose levels, basal and bolus insulin doses, and metabolic factors following implementation of a very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD). Sensor-derived time glucose ranges will serve as a surrogate marker of hemoglobin A1c given the short duration of the study. Safety measures of the diet will also be assessed, including daily fasting ketone levels.\n\nThe first hypothesis of the study is that use of a VLCD with strict monitoring of ketosis will reduce glycemic variability and increase time in target range, defined as 70-180 mg/dL by reducing the time in the hyperglycemic (\\>180 mg/dL) and hypoglycemic ranges (\\<70 mg/dL). Decreased carbohydrate intake will lead to less postprandial hyperglycemia. Lower insulin doses for meals and snacks as a result of decreased carbohydrate intake will lessen postprandial hypoglycemia as well."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Type 1 Diabetes"], "keywords": ["very low carbohydrate diet"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SEQUENTIAL", "interventionModelDescription": "Following enrollment, participants will follow a standard carbohydrate diet for 2 weeks.
