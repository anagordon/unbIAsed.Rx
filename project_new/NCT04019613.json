The study will correlate the lung ultrasound findings with cardiac hemodynamics and measurements of extravascular lung water in an effort to better understand the pathophysiology of exertional dyspnea.", "detailedDescription": "Exercise induced elevation of left ventricular (LV) filling pressures can be the source of chronic dyspnea. Ultimately, high LV filling pressure leads to the development of extravascular lung water (EVLW) which can cause symptoms of dyspnea. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a highly feasible, non-invasive procedure that is extremely sensitive for detecting EVLW. The sonographic signature of EVLW is a reverberation artifact called a \"B-Line\". The study will evaluate the etiology of sonographic B-Lines using invasive hemodynamic catheterization while simultaneously measuring the amount of EVLW present during exercise stress testing using transpulmonary thermodilution. The study aim is to demonstrate that the severity of EVLW, assessed by number of B-Lines, will correlate with LV filling pressures. In addition, the study will test the hypothesis that patients demonstrating dynamic increases in sonographic B-Lines with exercise will also display more severe symptoms of dyspnea, altered ventilatory mechanics (higher ratio of minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2)), and reduced aerobic capacity (lower peak oxygen consumption (VO2))."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dyspnea", "Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction"], "keywords": ["dyspnea", "heart failure with preserved ejection fraction", "pulmonary edema", "lung ultrasound", "extravascular lung water"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "All patients undergoing a clinically indicated invasive cardiac hemodynamic exercise test will be eligible for enrollment into the study.", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 4, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Subjects undergoing clinical invasive hemodynamic stress test", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects scheduled for standard-of-care, clinically indicated, invasive hemodynamic stress test will undergo lung ultrasound and assessment of extravascular lung water by pulmonary thermodilution technique.", "interventionNames": ["Diagnostic Test: Lung ultrasound"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DIAGNOSTIC_TEST", "name": "Lung ultrasound", "description": "Lung ultrasound will be performed at baseline (resting), prior to exercise with passive leg elevation, after 1.5 minutes of 20 Watts exercise, during each subsequent stage, at peak workload and at 1 minute recovery.
