The investigators have developed a 5-minute cognitive screen (5-Cog) coupled with a decision tree to overcome the technical, cultural and logistic barriers of current cognitive screens to improve dementia care in primary care patients with cognitive concerns.", "detailedDescription": "Despite the availability of numerous cognitive assessment tools, cognitive impairment related to dementia is frequently under-diagnosed in primary care settings, and is a more prevalent problem among older African-Americans and Hispanics than among older whites. Missed detection delays treatment of reversible conditions as well as provision of support services and critical planning. To overcome the technical, cultural and logistic barriers of current cognitive screens and dementia care in primary care settings the investigators have developed a 5-minute cognitive screen (5-Cog) coupled with a decision tree to identify persons at high risk of developing dementia in multi-ethnic primary care populations.\n\nThe 5-Cog includes the Picture based Memory Impairment Screen (PMIS), Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR), and a brief non-memory picture based test (Symbol Match). The cognitive assessment will sort patients with 'cognitive impairment' from those with 'no cognitive impairment'. It is coupled with a decision tree to guide clinicians through the follow up based on results of the 5-Cog.\n\nThe primary objective is to test the ability of the 5-Cog and decision tree paradigm to improve dementia care in primary care patients with cognitive concerns.\n\nThe investigators propose a single-blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) in 1,200 older primary care patients with cognitive concerns who will be randomized to receive the 5-Cog (intervention group) or a 5-minute health literacy and grip assessment (active control group). Non-physicians will administer the intervention and control assessments in primary care sites and will provide results for both arms to the treating physician with a decision tree follow up guide based on the results of the assessments."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dementia", "Cognitive Impairment", "Mild Cognitive Impairment", "Neurocognitive Disorders"], "keywords": ["Cognitive screening", "Primary care", "Dementia", "Cognitive Impairment", "Mild Cognitive Impairment"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SCREENING", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1201, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "5-Cog", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The 5-Cog coupled with a decision tree is a simple, 5-minute procedure that will identify older persons with cognitive impairment in primary care settings, and flag them for further evaluation.
