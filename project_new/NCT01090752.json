Their use is however associated with fluid retention and an increased risk of congestive heart failure. We previously demonstrated that pioglitazone increases proximal sodium reabsorption in healthy volunteers. This study examines the effects of pioglitazone on renal sodium handling in subjects prone to insulin resistance, i.e. diabetic and/or hypertensive subjects.\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-way, cross-over study, we examined the effects of pioglitazone (45mg daily during 6 weeks) or placebo on renal, systemic and hormonal responses to changes in sodium intake in 16 individuals, 8 with type 2 diabetic and 8 with hypertension."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes", "Hypertension"], "keywords": ["diabetes", "blood pressure", "pioglitazone", "sodium", "insulin resistance, renal function, sodium, pioglitazone"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 16, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Pioglitazone", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Pioglitazone", "Drug: Metformin"]}, {"label": "Metformine", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study was to explore the effects of pioglitazone (45 mg q.d. for 6 weeks) on the renal, hormonal and blood pressure responses to changes in sodium intake in a population prone to insulin resistance", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Metformin"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Pioglitazone", "description": "placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study was to explore the effects of pioglitazone (45 mg q.d. for 6 weeks) on the renal, hormonal and blood pressure responses to changes in sodium intake in a population prone to insulin resistance", "armGroupLabels": ["Pioglitazone"], "otherNames": ["Actos"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Metformin", "description": "placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study was to explore the effects of pioglitazone (45 mg q.d. for 6 weeks) on the renal, hormonal and blood pressure responses to changes in sodium intake in a population prone to insulin resistance", "armGroupLabels": ["Metformine", "Pioglitazone"], "otherNames": ["Glucophage", "Glumetza", "Fortamet", "Riomet"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Effects of Pioglitazone on Renal Hemodynamics", "description": "At the end of each treatment diet phase, renal clearances were performed for the determination of GFR and RBF", "timeFrame": "2008"}, {"measure": "Effects of Pioglitazone on Sodium and Lithium Clearances", "description": "At the end of each treatment and diet phase, 24 urine collections were collected for the determination of sodium and lithium clearances", "timeFrame": "2007"}, {"measure": "Effects of Pioglitazone on 24h Blood Pressure Control", "description": "24 hour blood pressure measurements were performed after each treatment/diet phase", "timeFrame": "march 2009"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Effects of Pioglitazone on Salt Sensitivity", "timeFrame": "2009"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Type II Diabetes\n* Hypertension\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cardiac or renal diseases\n* Anaemia\n* Drugs like aspirin, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal replacement therapy.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "maximumAge": "70 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"overallOfficials": [{"name": "Antoinette Pechere-Bertschi, MD", "affiliation": "University Hospital, Geneva", "role": "STUDY_DIRECTOR"}], "locations": [{"facility": "Pech\u00e8re-Bertschi Antoinette", "city": "Geneva", "zip": "1211", "country": "Switzerland", "geoPoint": {"lat": 46.20222, "lon": 6.14569}}]}, "referencesModule": {"references": [{"pmid": "21752899", "type": "DERIVED", "citation": "Zanchi A, Pechere-Bertschi A, Burnier M, Bonny O.
