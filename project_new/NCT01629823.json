Participants are randomly assigned in equal allocation to one of three treatments: CPAP 10 cm water (H\u2082O) (high) vs. CPAP 5 cm H\u2082O (medium) vs. CPAP Sham (less than 1 cm H\u2082O, Low). The treatment period is 12 weeks with airways reactivity assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment and after a 2 week washout.", "detailedDescription": "It is now well established that failure to rhythmically apply strain to airway smooth muscle leads to change in the biomechanics of the smooth muscle characterized by shortened resting length and increased sensitivity to pharmacologic constrictors. Patients with asthma have physiologic airway characteristics that recapitulate this condition - increased airway tone and increased sensitivity to methacholine. It is our underlying hypothesis that asthma, although it may be initiated by allergic airway inflammation, is promoted by decreased tidal force fluctuations during recumbent sleep. If this is true, then treatments that increase tidal force fluctuations of airways should reverse these abnormalities. One treatment that increases tidal force fluctuations is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP prevents a fall in end expiratory lung volume and prevents closure of airways in dependent regions of the lung thereby permitting the stresses of tidal breathing to apply strain to airways. Preliminary data in 15 asthmatics showed that 1 week of 10cm H\u2082O nocturnal CPAP was associated with a remarkable 2.7-fold increase in the concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\u2081) (PC20). The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter study of 5 and 10 cm H\u2082O CPAP in order to verify these findings; to assess the effect of nocturnal CPAP on airways reactivity; to determine the durability of the effect over 12 weeks; to assess the safety, tolerability and adherence to this treatment; and to explore if there are clinically meaningful benefits. The study will be conducted at 18 centers of the American Lung Association-Asthma Clinical Research Centers (ALA-ACRC) with the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nA substudy of High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) will also be conducted at a subset of the ACRC clinics. A total of 54 subjects (18 per arm)who are randomized in the main study will be voluntarily enrolled in the substudy to compare the structural changes in the airways across treatment groups and to correlate structural changes with the physiological changes. A total of two visits will be conducted. HRCT Visit 1 will be performed after randomization in the main CPAP study, and prior to initiation of CPAP. HRCT Visit 2 will be performed between weeks 10 and 12 of CPAP, at a different day or prior of methacholine challenge testing.Two CT scans will be performed each at different lung volume at each visit (Total of 4 scans for the study duration). The first volume will be at Total Lung Capacity (TLC), followed by another CT scan at Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 209, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "CPAP less than 1 cm H\u2082O", "type": "SHAM_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Device: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (Resmed, Swift, Mirage)"]}, {"label": "CPAP 10cm H\u2082O", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Device: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (Resmed, Swift, Mirage)"]}, {"label": "CPAP 5cm H\u2082O", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Device: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (Resmed, Swift, Mirage)"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (Resmed, Swift, Mirage)", "description": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (Resmed, Swift, Mirage): Participants will be randomized to one of three pre-set CPAP pressures: less than 1 cm water (H\u2082O), 5 cm H\u2082O or 10 cm H\u2082O.
