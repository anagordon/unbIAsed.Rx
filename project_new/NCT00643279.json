The premise of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a novel heart failure management strategy based on information obtained from the IHM system in reducing heart failure morbidity compared to a strategy based on standard medical care alone.\n\nAfter baseline evaluation and verification that entrance criteria were met, all subjects were implanted with a Chronicle IHM and pressure sensor lead. Following successful implantation, subjects were randomized to either the CHRONICLE group or CONTROL group. Subjects randomized to the CHRONICLE group were managed using Chronicle, specifically trended RV and estimated PA pressure, heart rate and activity data, whereas subjects randomized to the CONTROL group were treated conventionally without the use of the Chronicle data. In the case that implantation was not successful, subjects were exited from the study if no procedure related adverse events were identified; procedure related adverse events were followed through to resolution before the subject were withdrawn from the study.\n\nSubjects remained randomized until their six month clinic visit had been completed. Following the subject's six month visit, clinicians were granted access to the CONTROL subject's trended Chronicle data on the Chronicle website, and subjects were seen in the clinic for a protocol-required visit every six months until exit from the study."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["implantable hemodynamic monitor", "Intracardiac pressures"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 277, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "CHRONICLE", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects randomized to the CHRONICLE group were managed using data from an implantable hemodynamic monitoring (IHM) device, including trended right ventricular (RV) and estimated pulmonary arterial (PA) pressures, heart rate and activity data.
