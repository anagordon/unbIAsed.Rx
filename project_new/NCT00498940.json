This study will compare extended temporary biventricular pacing versus standard of care by assessing patients randomized to the two groups, from the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass, until the conclusion of pharmacologic circulatory support in the intensive care unit. In addition, effects of biventricular pacing will be tested in all patients, at three time points, using different measures of blood flow. Results from this research will demonstrate whether temporary BiVP improves cardiac output after open-heart surgery and whether ventricular pacing optimization increases cardiac output in this setting. Success would lead to the development of recommendations for use of BiVP postoperatively and would stimulate the development of pacemakers with appropriate features.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the optimum pacing protocol (POPT) will increase cardiac index (CI) by 15% (from approximately 2.30 to 2.64 L/min/m2) compared to standard of care as measured by thermodilution 12-24 hours postoperatively. Secondary objectives include defining POPT at three time points within 24 hours of surgery. The investigator will examine which forms of cardiac dysfunction benefit from temporary pacing using direct and indirect measures of perfusion and cardiac function. The investigator will also analyze survival, length of stay, incidence of arrhythmias, and cost of postoperative care.", "detailedDescription": "Biventricular pacing (BiVP) reverses intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). BiVP improves LV function and cardiac index (Cl) at no energy cost. In the MIRACLE trial, in patients with DCM, IVCD and LV ejection fraction \\<35%, demonstrated improved subjective and objective measures of exercise tolerance and cardiac function with BiVP. BiVP benefits many, but selection criteria are not fully developed, and 30% of recipients are \"nonresponders,\" at a cost of more than $2 billion/year. Preliminary data suggest that BiVP can benefit patients with low output states after cardiac surgery. This study will assess surgical application of BiVP while assessing mechanisms of action and optimization. 190 cardiac surgery patients will be randomized with LV dysfunction preoperatively to paced and standard of care groups. BiVP will be optimized and continued postoperatively until patients are stable. BiVP will be assessed transiently in all patients at three time points. The primary end point is a 15% improvement in thermal dilution Cl measured in the intensive care unit (ICU). Effects of heart rate, atrioventricular delay, ventricular pacing site, and interventricular delay on Cl will be assessed using a randomized sequence of data collection. Secondary endpoints include incidence of arrhythmias, inotropic support, urine output, weight gain, morbidity, mortality, and ICU costs. These studies are important because of a high probability of clinical benefit. The methods employed will provide precision, breadth of measurement, and range of pacing sites superior to any other setting. The protocol will provide new and important scientific information that will benefit not only surgical patients but also the general population of BiVP recipients."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["LV function, Compliance, wall motion, echocardiography"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 111, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Biventricular Pacing", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "After weaning from bypass, patients received temporary biventricular pacing for 24 hours.
