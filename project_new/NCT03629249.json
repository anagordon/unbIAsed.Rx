The study included:\n\n* a Screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility;\n* a Run-in period of 4 or 10 weeks to evaluate maintenance of asthma control and to collect baseline safety data. The Run-in period was 4 weeks for patients coming with high-dose ICS/LABA (inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting beta-agonist) and 10 weeks for patients switching from mid-dose to high-dose ICS/LABA as per protocol during the run-in period;\n* a Treatment period of 52 weeks. Upon completion of the Run-in period, all patients who met eligibility criteria were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (fevipiprant 150 mg or 450 mg or placebo once daily) in a ratio 1:1:1. Randomized patients were stratified according to their peripheral blood eosinophil count (\\< 250 cells/\u03bcl or \u2265 250 cells/\u03bcl);\n* a Follow-up period of 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug to collect additional data for safety variables.\n\nThe main purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg once daily), compared with placebo, as add-on to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) treatment step 4 or 5 SoC asthma therapy in terms of avoidance of SCS use over 52 weeks in patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma and high eosinophil counts (eosinophil count at Visit 1 \u2265250 cells/ \u03bcl) and in the overall patient population regardless of eosinophil counts.\n\nOn 16-Dec-2019 the sponsor decided to terminate study CQAW039A2323 earlier than the planned study completion. There were no safety findings with fevipiprant that contributed to this decision. The planned treatment period of 52 weeks was not completed by any patient; patients were treated for a median time of 14 weeks in each group and a maximum of up to 36 weeks."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Bronchial Diseases", "Respiratory Tract Diseases", "Lung Diseases", "Obstructive Lung Diseases", "Respiratory Hypersensitivity", "Hypersensitivity", "Immune System Diseases", "Fevipiprant", "QAW039"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 604, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "QAW039 150 mg", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "QAW039 150 mg once daily orally", "interventionNames": ["Drug: QAW039 150 mg once daily"]}, {"label": "QAW039 450 mg", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "QAW039 450 mg once daily orally", "interventionNames": ["Drug: QAW039 450 mg once daily"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Placebo to QAW039 once daily orally", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo once daily"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo once daily", "description": "Placebo to QAW039 once daily (one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 150 mg and one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 450 mg).", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "QAW039 150 mg once daily", "description": "QAW039 150 mg once daily (one tablet of blinded QAW039 150 mg to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 450 mg)", "armGroupLabels": ["QAW039 150 mg"], "otherNames": ["fevipiprant 150 mg"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "QAW039 450 mg once daily", "description": "QAW039 450 mg once daily (one tablet of blinded QAW039 450 mg to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 150 mg)", "armGroupLabels": ["QAW039 450 mg"], "otherNames": ["fevipiprant 450 mg"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Total Systemic Corticosteroid Dose in mg Prednisone/Prednisolone or Equivalent Over 52 Weeks in the Overall Population", "description": "All participants were provided with prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) tablets that could be used according to the asthma plan along with an electronic diary (e-Diary/ePEF).
