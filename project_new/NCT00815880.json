The product is designed to help reduce the symptoms of heart failure and help patients function better with daily activities. The study evaluates multiple measures of heart function and whether the patient's quality of life has been improved since the device implant. The patient will have several visits after the device implant to assess how well they are doing and to monitor any safety concerns.", "detailedDescription": "Sunshine Heart Inc. is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center trial to assess the safety and provide indications for performance of the Sunshine Heart C-PulseTM System (\"C-Pulse\u2122\").\n\nThe current need is for a counterpulsation device or method that is effective enough to make its application appealing as a long-term implant to a large number of patients and physicians. It must be simple and safe, with a straight-forward implant procedure, and with long-term measurable patient benefits. Further, it would be advantageous for the counterpulsation device to be smaller, easier to insert, ambulatory, disconnectable, and not in the bloodstream. Such a device may be more readily adopted by a wider group of cardiologists and surgeons, and be suitable for a wider group of people in NYHA Class III or IV heart failure. It is important to point out that a counterpulsation device is aimed to augment native heart function and is fundamentally different from total artificial hearts, left ventricular assist devices and heart transplants which are meant to be a total replacement or an alternative to the native heart. Thus, the counterpulsation device is considered non-obligatory and not life-supporting.\n\nSunshine Heart, Inc has proposed C-Pulse\u2122, a novel ambulatory, non-obligatory, non-blood contacting extra-ascending aortic counterpulsation system. The C-Pulse\u2122 System is designed to be implanted without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass or extensive dissection, to be able to be activated immediately, to augment heart function in a safe manner and to provide sustained relief from heart failure symptoms. It can be turned off safely, and similarly, in failure modes, is considered to have an associated low risk of death or disability, other than the recurrence of heart failure symptoms. C-Pulse\u2122 is not an alternative to the heart, it is an augmentation device, and it does not preclude the use of therapies that provide full circulatory support such as heart transplantation or LVADs.\n\nThe C-Pulse\u2122 System consists of a counterpulsation Cuff secured around the outside of the ascending aorta, the main blood vessel out of the heart. The Cuff and a heart signal sensing wire are attached to an external driver. The external Driver inflates and deflates the Cuff in sequence with the ECG signal to assist heart function and improve the pumping capacity of the heart. The Cuff deflects the aorta in a \"thumb-printing\" manner which has been optimized to minimize aortic wall strain and maximize blood volume displacement per beat. The C-Pulse\u2122 System is non-blood contacting, simple to insert, and can be turned on and off as required; all natural blood pathways are maintained - there is no exposure of foreign material to the bloodstream."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart Failure", "Device", "Implantable", "Active", "Class III and Class IV", "Counterpulsation"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "The C-Pulse System is indicated for use in subjects with moderate to severe heart failure who are refractory to optimal medical therapy", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 21, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Implantable Counterpulsation Therapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The primary study population will include 20 patients enrolled and implanted with C-Pulse.
