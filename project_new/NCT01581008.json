Briefly, the two interventions are:\n\n1. A palliative symptom management and psychosocial care intervention named Collaborative Care to Alleviate Symptoms and Adjust to Illness (CASA) that includes\n\n   1. evidence-based palliative symptom management of breathlessness, fatigue, and pain, provided by a nurse;\n   2. a 6-session structured psychosocial care protocol targeting depression and adjustment to illness, supplemented by informal (family) caregiver assessment and support, provided by a social worker or psychologist; and\n   3. brief weekly team meetings with the nurse, social worker/psychologist and a palliative care specialist, cardiologist, and primary care provider.\n2. A psychospiritual intervention that is home-based, self-guided, and requires minimal resources. It will be delivered in written modular form via US Mail along with brief weekly telephone support.\n\nThe specific aims of the study are to:\n\n1. Examine intervention feasibility and determine preliminary estimates of intervention effect\n\n   1. Determine patient participation rates and cohort retention\n   2. Conduct a preliminary assessment of outcomes by measuring pre-post changes in quality of life, depressive symptoms, health status, life meaning, and spirituality.\n2.
