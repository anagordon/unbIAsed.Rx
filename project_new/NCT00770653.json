The most common pattern of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes are elevated triglyceride levels, decreased hih-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a predominance of small dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Each of these dyslipidemia features is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nPioglitazone and Metformin are established drugs which can be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This study will investigate the effects of treatment with fixed Pioglitazone/Metformin combination therapy of Metformin and Glimepiride in Metformin-pretreated type 2 diabetic patients with
