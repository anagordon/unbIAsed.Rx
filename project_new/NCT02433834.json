Reversibility: Diagnosis of asthma confirmed at Screening (Visits 1 and 2) with demonstration of reversibility to a bronchodilator defined as an FEV1 increase of at least 12% and at least 200 mL, 30 to 60 minutes after the inhalation of 4 puffs of salbutamol/albuterol (Ventolin HFA)\n6. Pulmonary Function: Must have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 \u226560% and \u226490% of predicted normal value at Visit 1a/b and Visit 2a/b\n7.

Results of clinical laboratory tests conducted at Screening (Visit 1a) must be acceptable to the Investigator.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Life-Threatening Asthma: A subject must not have life-threatening asthma. Lifethreatening asthma is defined as a history of significant asthma episode(s) requiring intubation associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, hypoxic seizures, or asthma related syncopal episode(s) within the 12 months prior to Visit 1a (Screening).\n2. Worsening Asthma: A subject must not have experienced a worsening of asthma that involved an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or use of oral/parenteral corticosteroids within 6 weeks of Screening (Visit 1a).\n3.

Renal: a. Subjects with symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy that is clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator (if treated and asymptomatic, the subject is eligible for enrollment). Subjects with a trans-urethral resection of prostate or full resection of the prostate within 6 months prior to Visit 1a are excluded from the study.\n\n    b.

Note: Subjects with overactive bladder syndrome treated with oral anticholinergics that have been on treatment for at least one month are allowed in the study.\n13. Glaucoma: Subjects with a diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma will be excluded, regardless of whether or not they have been treated. Subjects with a diagnosis of glaucoma (non-angle closure), that in the opinion of the Investigator, has not been adequately treated will also be excluded.
