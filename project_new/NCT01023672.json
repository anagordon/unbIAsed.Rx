Armodafinil is a wake-promoting medication that has been developed for treatment of patients with narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and other disorders which cause excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nThe drug used in this study is considered investigational, which means it has either not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use or for the use described in this study. However the FDA has allowed the use of this drug/device in this research study.\n\nIn this study, patients with DLB will receive daily oral Armodafinil tablets, and their response to treatment will be assessed over 12 weeks. This study does not involve any placebo medication, so all patients will receive Armodafinil treatment.", "detailedDescription": "In patients with DLB, the following aims/objectives will be addressed by comparing data on key measures at baseline and at 4 and 12 weeks of therapy:\n\nPrimary Aims - to test the hypotheses that armodafinil therapy at 150-250 mg every morning:\n\n* will result in improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) (Aim 1A)\n* will result in improvement in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) (Aim 1B)\n* will result in improvement in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinician's Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) (Aim 1C)\n* will be well-tolerated with no significant side-effects present (Aim 1D)\n\nSecondary Aims - to test the hypotheses that armodafinil therapy at 150-250 mg every morning will result in improvement in:\n\n* cognition as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and other focused neuropsychological tests (Aim 2A)\n* neuropsychiatric morbidity, particularly apathy, depression, visual hallucinations, and delusions, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Aim 2B)\n* functional status as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) (Aim 2C)\n* patient and caregiver quality of life (QOL) as measured by the linear analog scale (LASA) (Aim 2D)"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dementia With Lewy Bodies"], "keywords": ["Dementia with Lewy Bodies", "hypersomnolence", "cognition", "neuropsychiatric morbidity", "quality of life"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 20, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Armodifinil", "type": "OTHER", "description": "150-250 mg armodafinil by mouth daily", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Armodafinil"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Armodafinil", "description": "150-250 mg armodafinil by mouth daily", "armGroupLabels": ["Armodifinil"], "otherNames": ["Nuvigil"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Mean Initial Sleep Latency as Measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)", "description": "The MWT measures the subject's ability to stay awake while sitting quietly in a chair.
