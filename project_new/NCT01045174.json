This study compares outcomes including hospital admission rates, number of nebulized treatments required, and patient/family satisfaction when a breath-actuated nebulizer device versus a conventional continuous-output nebulizer is used to deliver asthma medications to pediatric asthma patients in the emergency department."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Pediatric", "Emergency department", "Nebulizer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 180, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Breath-Actuated Nebulizer", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Participants are randomly assigned to receive bronchodilator treatments for asthma according to the standard of care using either a breath-actuated nebulizer device or a conventional continuous-output nebulizer.", "interventionNames": ["Device: Nebulizer (breath-actuated versus conventional continuous-output)"]}, {"label": "Conventional continuous-ouput nebulizer", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Participants are randomly assigned to receive bronchodilator treatments for asthma according to the standard of care using either a breath-actuated nebulizer device or a conventional continuous-output nebulizer", "interventionNames": ["Device: Nebulizer (breath-actuated versus conventional continuous-output)"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Nebulizer (breath-actuated versus conventional continuous-output)", "description": "Participants are randomly assigned to receive bronchodilator treatments for asthma according to the standard of care using either a breath-actuated nebulizer device or a conventional continuous-output nebulizer.
