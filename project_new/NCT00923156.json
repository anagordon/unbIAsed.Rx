An increase of angiotensin II is associated with progression of heart failure. Although the use of ACE-inhibitors in heart failure shows clinical benefit, an increase in angiotensin II due to an angiotensin II \"escape\" phenomenon is not desirable. It is not yet known if a direct renin inhibitor can reduce or even prevent the angiotensin II escape phenomenon associated with the use of an ACE-inhibitor. Therefore the study tested the effects of ramipril, aliskiren and the combination of both on levels of angiotensin II in the blood in patients with systolic heart failure"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"], "keywords": ["Heart failure", "Systolic", "Aliskiren", "Ramipril", "Angiotensin II", "Ang II", "Plasma Renin Activity", "PRA", "Plasma Renin Concentration", "PR,", "brain natriuretic peptide", "BNP", "urinary aldosterone", "Escape", "Pharmacokinetic", "PK"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 123, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Aliskiren", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "In open label run-in phase (period 1), patients started with ramipril 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg capsule once daily (o.d) depending on previous treatment with RAAS blockers and up-titrated to ramipril 10 mg capsule o.d by end of period 1.
