Wood smoke particles (WSP) derived from wildland and other fires account for a significant fraction of ambient air PM. Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation. While these effects are seen in both healthy and asthmatic individuals, many studies indicate that asthmatics have increased susceptibility to the effects of WSP. The investigators have developed a 500 \u03bcg/m3 WSP exposure protocol (levels similar to those encountered by firefighters and residents in close proximity to wildland burn sites) that induces airway and systemic inflammation in healthy volunteers. As with other pollutants, these inflammatory responses modulate non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), inflammatory cell recruitment to the airways (primarily neutrophils), and potentially cardiovascular function.\n\nThe investigators have focused on gamma tocopherol (\u03b3T) as a nutritional intervention to prevent inflammatory responses to air pollutants such as WSP. Building on animal and in vitro preclinical studies, the investigators have established that 1400 mg/day of oral \u03b3T-enriched supplement for 7 and 14 days in healthy volunteers and mild asthmatics, respectively, inhibited neutrophil influx into the airways, reduced production of sputum mucins, and improved mucociliary clearance following challenge with inhaled endotoxin, another common component of PM. The findings occurred in the context of significantly increased plasma concentrations of \u03b3T and its active metabolite 2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(\u03b2-Carboxy-Ethyl)-6-Hydroxychroman (\u03b3-CEHC). Given the findings in these early phase clinical trials, \u03b3T supplementation is an attractive approach to prevent WSP-induced adverse health effects. The investigators propose to use \u03b3T supplementation in a human model of WSP inhalation to mitigate key features of airway inflammation: inflammatory cell recruitment, production of inflammatory cytokines and mucous, and changes in airway physiology.\n\nGamma tocopherol will be administered in softgel form, with each softgel containing 700 mg of tocopherols, 89.5% of which is d-gamma tocopherol. Subjects will consume two softgels by mouth once daily for 7 days. This dosing regimen was chosen based on the results of the investigators' previous early phase clinical trials examining the impact of gamma tocopherol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced airway inflammation in healthy adults and adults with asthma. These studies tested a 7 and 14 day course of treatment, respectively, and found similar plasma concentrations of \u03b3T and active metabolites in both studies. Furthermore, the investigators showed in both studies that \u03b3T significantly reduced LPS-induced sputum neutrophilia compared to placebo. Based on the previous findings, the investigators will now study the efficacy of \u03b3T for mitigating WSP-induced airway inflammation.\n\nJanuary 2022 update: The existing, custom source of gamma tocopherol expired during the protocol paused period during Covid. The Gamma t is replaced by Gamma E Gems, manufactured by Carlson Labs, each capsule with 577mg of gamma tocopherol, based on Certificate of Analysis. Subjects will continue to ingest 2 capsules at each dosing, for a total dose of 1154mg.
