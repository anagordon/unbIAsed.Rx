To show equivalence, these data will be compared with the heart sounds data recorded by an FDA-cleared AUDCIOR AM device .\n\nThe study will enroll a minimum of 27 and a maximum of 35 subjects.\n\nParticipants will be adult patients (age \u2265 18 years) with at least seven patients over the age of 40 years. In addition, at least five patients with a history of heart failure will be included.\n\nFirst, participants will wear the AUDICOR-AM device for 15 minutes while sitting quietly. Then, the AUDICOR device will be removed and the participants will wear the WCD for 15 minutes while sitting quietly. Next, while wearing the WCD, participants will perform various activities of daily living, including at least 6 hours of overnight wear. Finally, the WCD will be removed and the participants will wear the AUDICOR again for 15 minutes while sitting quietly.\n\nThis is a single center, prospective, observational study. This is a non-significant risk device study as all biological study parameters will be measured noninvasively with the WCD defibrillation capability disabled. In addition, the study device will not be used as a replacement for regularly prescribed therapies or diagnostics."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "Each subject first wears the AUDICOR-AM device for 15 minutes while sitting.
