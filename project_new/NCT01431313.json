Subjects on oral background PAH therapy (ETRA or PDE5I) will be instructed to hold their regimen on the day of the study visit.\n\nSubjects will receive nebulized AIR001 doses escalated based upon safety and tolerability. The dose of inhaled nitrite will be delivered via electronic nebulizer. During the study right heart/pulmonary artery hemodynamics will be measured as well as noninvasive systemic blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be tested for the changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) using standard clinical protocol hemodynamic recordings of right atrial, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures, in addition to cardiac output at time zero,\n\n3 Day phone follow up\n\n30 Day follow up visit: All subjects enrolled in the study will be followed for 30 days (+/- 5 day window) after completion of the study treatment.
