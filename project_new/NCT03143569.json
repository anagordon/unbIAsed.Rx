One method tests for how long it takes the patient's blood to clot and uses that to determine if they are on the right dose of heparin. The other method uses a more direct measure of how much heparin is in the blood. The hypothesis is that the method that more directly measures how much heparin is in the patient's blood will provide better medical results for the patient's care after they have the heart pump implant. To that end, the investigators are conducting this feasibility trial to establish the logistics associated with the implementation of these heparin monitoring approaches.", "detailedDescription": "Heart failure is a medical condition that is on the rise in the US and is associated with an enormous cost of $30 billion in healthcare expenses. People with heart failure may be treated with an LVAD that is connected to their heart and helps it pump the blood from the left side of the heart into the blood vessels that delivers blood to the body. These devices can be used to treat heart failure for the long term or they can be used while a patient waits for a heart transplant. In either case, the use of these devices is increasing.\n\nOne of the primary risks associated with LVADs are those related to blood clotting. Maintenance of the LVAD depends on preventing blood clots especially right after the surgery that puts them in place. This requires putting patients with LVADs on blood thinners and then monitoring the blood thinner levels carefully so that they don't have problems with bleeding too easily or, on the other hand, forming blood clots if they aren't on the right dose of blood thinners. Excessive bleeding - called hemorrhaging - is the more common problem after surgery and half of all patients that receive an LVAD will require a blood transfusion within the first 30 days after they receive the device. A laboratory test that measures how quickly blood clots is used to determine if the patient has the right amount of blood thinners. The current standard test is called \"activated partial thromboplastin time \\[aPTT\\].\" There are problems with the reliability of this test because it reacts with other elements in the blood. Alternately, there is a test that more directly measures the amount of heparin blood thinner rather than coagulation time and may be more reliable than aPTT called anti-factor Xa \\[anti-Xa\\].\n\nThe investigators have developed process diagrams that show steps for making decisions \\[called nomograms\\] that tell a nurse or doctor how to manage the heparin levels using test results from the aPTT test or the anti-Xa test; however, both tests will be performed at each decision time point, but the care team will only be told the results from the testing to which their patient is assigned.\n\nThe purpose of this feasibility study is to establish feasibility of using the two nomograms to determine which provides the optimal clinical information for improving patients' outcomes that have had LVADs placed.\n\nPotential subjects will be recruited prior to their surgery and may decline to participate anytime before or after the surgery takes place. Subjects will be randomized to the aPTT nomogram or the anti-Xa nomogram. If they withdraw consent, they will receive the aPTT standard of care monitoring. The study procedures are performed by the clinical care team. Clinicians will be trained to use the nomograms."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Left Sided Heart Failure", "Left Ventricular Assist Device", "Anticoagulant Therapy", "Gastro Intestinal Bleeding", "Thrombosis, LVAD", "Anti-factor Xa", "aPTT", "Heparin"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 20, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "aPTT nomogram", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "aPTT guided heparin management", "interventionNames": ["Device: aPTT guided heparin management", "Device: Anti-factor Xa guided heparin management"]}, {"label": "Anti-factor Xa nomogram", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Anti-factor Xa guided heparin management", "interventionNames": ["Device: aPTT guided heparin management", "Device: Anti-factor Xa guided heparin management"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "aPTT guided heparin management", "description": "post-surgical implantation anti-coagulation therapy to prevent clotting in ventricular assist device.", "armGroupLabels": ["Anti-factor Xa nomogram", "aPTT nomogram"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Anti-factor Xa guided heparin management", "description": "post-surgical implantation anti-coagulation therapy to prevent clotting in ventricular assist device", "armGroupLabels": ["Anti-factor Xa nomogram", "aPTT nomogram"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Nomogram Feasibility", "description": "Questionnaires evaluating pragmatic application of nomograms.
