Eligibility will be determined based on Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score and body mass index (BMI) at their 12-month visit. Participants will be randomized into an intervention or an active control arm after completing their 18-month visit. Participants will be consented into the pilot study during or after their 18-month visit. Participants will be put into groups of 7-10 for the pilot. Once formed, groups will have four 1-hour weekly visits. A person will be allowed to make up one missed session. The make-up session will be conducted on the phone or in-person depending on scheduling availability of both participant and care coach. Participants will be given accelerometers at sessions 1 and 4 that they will be asked to wear for seven days and return along with an activity diary. A follow-up survey will be administered about 30 days after the last pilot session in order to reassess the patient's asthma, obesity, exercise and medication beliefs and their adherence to asthma SMB.
