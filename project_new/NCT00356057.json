All patients enrolled into the clinical study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups using a randomization ratio of 2:2:1. Patients will be assigned to receive either biventricular (biV) pacing with CLS-based rate adaptive pacing using the legally marketed Protos DR/CLS (Group 1), or biventricular pacing with accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 2), or right ventricular (RV) pacing with accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 3).
