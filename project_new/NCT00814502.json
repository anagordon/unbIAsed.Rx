You can participate in this study if you have dementia of the Alzheimer's type or vascular dementia. This study involves placebo; a placebo is a tablet that looks exactly like Zolpidem CR, the study drug, but contains no active study drug. We will use placebos to see if the study results are due to the study drug or due to other reasons. Zolpidem CR is also called Ambien CR and is widely available by prescription. Zolpidem CR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term treatment of insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep).", "detailedDescription": "Sleep patterns normally change with age. Sleep/wake cycles appear to be compromised in people suffering from dementia. Most research involving sleep in dementia has involved community dwelling or nursing home residents. Relatively little is known about the sleep patterns of patients with dementia who develop acute behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and necessitate hospitalization. The relationship between sleep disturbances in these patients and behavioral/psychiatric symptoms is also insufficiently studied. The current study will examine these two sets of data (sleep/wake cycles and clinical symptoms) in a population of elderly subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) or vascular dementia (VD) during their hospitalization period. We will compare the sleep outcome measures (primarily sleep efficiency) and clinical outcome measures in subjects treated with Zolpidem CR or Placebo. We will utilize a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to test our hypothesis that targeting sleep disturbances in hospitalized elderly subjects with DAT or VD leads to improvement in sleep and clinical outcomes."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dementia", "Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia, Vascular", "Sleep Disorders", "Circadian Dysregulation"], "keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Dementia, vascular", "Actigraphy", "Circadian dysregulation", "Sleep Disorders", "Circadian rhythm"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 20, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Zolpidem CR", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Subjects randomized to Zolpidem CR", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Zolpidem CR"]}, {"label": "Placebo", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Subjects randomized to Placebo", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Zolpidem CR", "description": "After a 48-hour period of baseline actigraphy and clinical measurements, study subjects were randomized to take either Zolpidem CR 6.25mg by mouth (1 pink tablet) or Placebo by mouth (also 1 pink tablet) for up to 3 weeks or the end of the subjects' hospital stay.", "armGroupLabels": ["Zolpidem CR"], "otherNames": ["Ambien CR"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "After a 48-hour period of baseline actigraphy and clinical measurements, study subjects were randomized to take either Zolpidem CR 6.25mg by mouth (1 pink tablet) or Placebo by mouth (also 1 pink tablet) for up to 3 weeks or the end of the subjects' hospital stay.", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Sleep Efficiency", "description": "Sleep efficiency during the down interval.
