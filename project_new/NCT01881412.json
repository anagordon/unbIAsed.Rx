A lot of children with uncontrolled asthma use emergency departments for asthma care, and so this is an ideal place for an intervention for these children. One intervention is prescribing inhaled steroids to children with uncontrolled asthma, but currently this is rarely done in the emergency department. Inhaled steroids have been shown to be good at making children better long-term when they have uncontrolled asthma.\n\nThis study identifies children in the emergency department with uncontrolled asthma using a tool called the Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (PACCI). If children meet criteria for uncontrolled asthma they will be randomly assigned to either: 1) routine asthma care which includes close follow up with their doctor or 2) prescribing of an inhaled corticosteroid from the emergency department. The investigators hypothesize that children who are prescribed inhaled steroids for uncontrolled asthma from the emergency department will have better 6 month asthma control than children who receive routine asthma care.", "detailedDescription": "Specific aim 1 - An ED-based RCT to determine if ICS prescription in children identified using the PACCI as having uncontrolled asthma results in less asthma morbidity compared to routine asthma care. We hypothesize that children receiving ICS prescriptions will have fewer unscheduled health care use for asthma exacerbations (doctor's office visits, ED visits, or hospitalizations), and greater quality of life.\n\nSpecific aim 2 - Thematic analysis of interviews with parents who are adherent versus non-adherent with ICS prescription filling and use to determine the factors associated with adherence. We hypothesize that factors will include: 1) Parent beliefs about the chronic versus episodic nature of asthma, 2) Parent's knowledge of benefits and risks of ICS, and 3) Provision and use of an asthma action plan."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Children", "Inhaled Corticosteroids", "Emergency Department"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 118, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Child receives: 1) standardized asthma discharge instructions, and the intervention which is 2) inhaled corticosteroid prescription with accompanying instructions.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: fluticasone", "Other: Standard Asthma Discharge Instructions"]}, {"label": "Routine Asthma Care", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Child receives: 1) Standard Asthma Discharge Instructions.
