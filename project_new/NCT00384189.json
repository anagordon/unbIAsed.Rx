Treatment medication will be administered as follows: ciclesonide or placebo will be inhaled once daily in the evening. The study consists of a baseline period (2 to 4 weeks) and a treatment period (12 weeks). The study provides further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.", "detailedDescription": "The drug being tested is called ciclesonide. This study looked at the safety and efficacy of inhaled ciclesonide in children with asthma. The study enrolled 1080 patients.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups which were undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study:\u2022 Ciclesonide 40 \u00b5g, 80 \u00b5g or 160 \u00b5g \u2022 Placebo- this is similar to study drug but has no active ingredient. Ciclesonide was inhaled via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI with HFA-134a propellant), with or without spacer, once daily in the evening throughout the study. All participants were asked to document daily AM and PM peak expiratory flow (PEF), daytime and nighttime asthma symptom scores and number of puffs of rescue medicine in an electronic diary. This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study was 20 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic plus a final visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Asthma"], "keywords": ["Asthma", "Ciclesonide", "children"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1080, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Ciclesonide 40 \u00b5g", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Placebo-matching ciclesonide, inhaled via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with 1,1,1,2-hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-134a as propellant, once daily, in the evening for 2 to 4 weeks in the Baseline period followed by ciclesonide 40 \u00b5g, inhaled via a MDI with HFA-134a as propellant, once daily in the evening for 12 weeks.
