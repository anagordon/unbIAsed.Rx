Spacer devices are permitted during reversibility testing only. The Investigator or delegate may decide whether or not to use a spacer for the reversibility testing.\n\n  * If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2, patients may be permitted to enter the study with historical evidence of reversibility that was performed within 5 years prior to Visit 1.\n  * Alternatively, patients may be permitted to enter the study with a historical positive bronchoprovocation test (defined as a provoked fall in FEV1 of 20% by bronchoconstriction agent e.g., methacholine, histamine) or equivalent test (e.g., astography) that was performed within 5 years prior to Visit 1.\n  * If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2 and historical data is not available, reversibility should be repeated once in an ad-hoc visit scheduled as close as possible from the first attempt (but not on the same day).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6-weeks of Visit 1.\n* Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation.\n* Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study.\n* Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or bladder-neck obstruction or severe renal impairment or urinary retention. BPH patients who are stable on treatment can be considered.\n* Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined by investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or between Visit 1 and Visit 99. Patients may be re-screened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening.\n* Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not
