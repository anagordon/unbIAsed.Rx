All patients must sign and date an Informed Consent Form consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines and local legislation prior to participation in the trial.\n2. Male or female patients aged at least 18 years at Visit 0 but not more than 75 years at Visit 0.\n3. All patients must have at least a 3 months history of asthma at the time of enrolment (signing ICF) into the trial. The initial diagnosis of asthma must have been made before the patient's age of 40.\n4. All patients must have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 = 60% predicted and = 90% of predicted normal at Visit 1.Variation of absolute pre-bronchodilator FEV1 values at Visit 1 and Visit 2 must be within \u00b1 30%.\n5. Patient's diagnosis of asthma has to be confirmed at Visit 1 with bronchodilator reversibility (ie 10 minutes prior to and 15-30 minutes after inhalation of 400 \u00b5g salbutamol) defined as an FEV1 increase of = 12% and = 200 mL.\n6. All patients must have a diagnosis of moderate persistent asthma and must be symptomatic despite their current maintenance treatment with medium doses of ICS.\n7. All patients must be symptomatic at Visit 1and Visit 2 as defined by an ACQ mean score of = 1.5.\n8. All patients must have maintenance treatment with stable medium daily dose of ICS for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n9. Patients must be never-smokers or ex-smokers who stopped smoking at least one year prior to enrolment (Visit 0) and who have a smoking history of less than 10 pack-years at Visit 0.\n10. Patients must be able to use the Respimat inhaler correctly.\n11. Patients must be able to perform all trial related procedures including technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and use of the AM3 (e-diary) compliance of at least 80% is required.\n12. Patients taking a chronic pulmonary medication allowed by the study protocol must be willing to continue this therapy for the entire duration of the study (exception: times of acute disease deterioration).\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients with a significant disease other than asthma. A significant disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may (i) put the patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii) influence the results of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the trial.\n2. Patients with a clinically relevant abnormal screening hematology or blood chemistry at Visit 1 if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in exclusion criterion no. 1.\n3. Patients requiring more than 12 puffs of rescue medication (salbutamol MDI) per 24 hours for more than 2 consecutive days between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (screening period).\n4. Patients with a recent history (ie six months or less) of Acute Coronary Syndrome (STEMI, non-STEMI, Unstable Angina Pectoris) prior to Visit 1 (screening).\n5. Patients who have been hospitalised for cardiac failure during the past year prior to Visit 1 (screening).\n6. Patients with any unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention or a change in drug therapy within the past year prior to Visit 1 (screening).\n7. Patients with lung diseases other than asthma (eg COPD).\n8. Patients with known active tuberculosis.\n9. Patients with malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years prior to Visit 1 (screening).

Pregnant or nursing women, including female patients with positive \u00df-HCG test at Visit 1.\n15. Female patients of child-bearing potential not using highly effective method of birth control. As defined in ICH (M3) \\[R09-1400\\], note 3, highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (ie less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner. Barrier contraceptives (eg male condom or diaphragm) are acceptable if used in combination with spermicides (eg foam, gel).\n\n    Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or post-menopausal for at least two years.\n16. Patients who have been treated with restricted medication prior to Visit 1 and/or during the screening period.\n17.
